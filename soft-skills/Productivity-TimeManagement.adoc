== Productivity and Time Management for the Overwhelmed - Josh Paulsen

=== Section 1: Introduction

=== Section 2: The Silent Killers of Productivity and Time Management

==== Fear and Our Brain's Default Setting

*If I had to pick the number one silent killer of our productivity and the biggest thing that holds people back from being as productive as they can possibly be, that would be your own brain and its desire to keep you safe*. *Now, all of us struggle with procrastination from time to time. In fact, in many cases, our procrastination is simply a symptom of fear, whether it be fear of failure, being concerned we won't live up to expectations or produce good enough work, or even if it's just a task that's outside of our comfort zone, we'll rationalize reason after reason*. But fear is almost always at the root cause. Now, when we find ourselves being busy without really moving forward, it's often because we're avoiding that most important task. But it's a task that makes us uncomfortable or something we're scared of. Now, I start with this silent killer first because it's critical to understand how your brain's designed. You see, we're all biologically wired for fear and to have a desire to stay within our comfort zone and to keep us safe. That's our brains. Number one goal is to keep us safe from harm. And it served us well over thousands of years, keeping our ancestors alive long enough so that you and I are here living and breathing today. But here's the thing. In the 21st century, especially for you and me, we're no longer living in the jungle dodging wild animals on a daily basis for our survival.*But it's not just physical harm that your brain is trying to protect you from. It's also emotional harm*. In fact, in many studies, the fear of public speaking ranks higher than even the fear of death. And as Jerry Seinfeld once said, that means that a funeral, more people would rather be in the casket than actually given the eulogy. *But because our brain doesn't distinguish the difference between physical or emotional harm, it wants to avoid both*. Now, this is a foundational principle that you must understand before we move forward. Your brain's doing its job when it tries to keep you from rejection or unpleasant experiences. It does this automatically, but you have to take control and override those subconscious warning signals. *Courage is not the absence of fear. It's the willingness to act in spite of fear*. And every single time you move through your fear, you further inoculate yourself from the fear that holds you back. It builds habits just like with anything else. So start today when your brain does its best to protect you and throws up those warning signals and tries to have you take the path of least resistance and procrastinate. Decide whether or not you actually need the protection. You have the power to move past those signals of fear and push right through it.

==== Overwhelm - How it holds you back and how you can beat it.

Welcome back. Now our next silent killer is overwhelmed. I'm sure you can identify it from time to time with this guy here in our picture. Now, whether it's your task piling up, you know, or maybe you're an entrepreneur and you're trying to manage it all, or even if you're a mother or a father that's trying to balance work with your family life, we all seem to be stretched further and further these days. *Now, here's the thing. When your brain gets overwhelmed, it's kind of like a breaker being shut off. Your brain just completely shuts down. Now, I hear this from my clients and my students all the time. They're overwhelmed and they don't even know where to start. And in many cases, when this happens, they freeze, it paralyzes them and they're just stuck in the mud. But the problem is those tasks don't go away. That only makes the problem worse. I do have some good news for you. However, it doesn't have to be this way. You see, overwhelm really is subjective. It's much more of an emotion that it is a reality. With the right system or structure in place, you can manage just about anything that comes your way. Please don't leave this lecture without really internalizing this fact. With the right system or structure in place, you can manage just about anything that comes your way*. Now, in this course, I'm going to show you multiple systems and strategies. But as an individual, you're unique. You've got different strengths and weaknesses and preferences than your neighbor or your co-worker. In the end, it's up to you to try on a few of our strategies and decide what works best for you and your personal situation and style. Now, these strategies are coming up later, but I don't want to leave you completely hanging until then. I want to give you a couple of quick suggestions right now.

One major source of overwhelm, I know for most of us, is caused by that open loop that happens in your head. Your brain thinks it's doing you a favor by continuing to remind you and remind you and remind you of all those open tasks and to dos you have in your to do list. But many times it chooses to remind us at the most inopportune time, perhaps when we're laying down to go to sleep at night and we'll continue to bombard us with all our open tasks. *The first thing you've got to do when you get overwhelmed is to get all those thoughts out of your head*. You've got to break out a piece of paper and a pen and perform a brain dump. Just get it all out. I mean, everything from there. Once you've got it all out on paper, you can prioritize it and break it into bite sized pieces. You can break out the urgent from the not so urgent and you can remove those tasks all together that really aren't priority. Then you can delegate or hand some of those tasks off to someone else. But the key is get it all out of your head onto paper. And once you have it on that paper, it's going to help your brain understand that everything's accounted for and it will help to reduce that continual open loop. *And once you've got it on paper, you can then start to organize it and create a plan*.

*Now, the other major source of overwhelm is due to complexity*, if we deem a project too large or too complex, it can freeze us in our tracks just like before. You've got to break out a pen and hash things out on paper. For example, let's say you've got a presentation do for a client. Now, that can be a very big task and one that can overwhelm you just by the size of it. Now, we're going to use this as an actual example. So let's say on your to do list, you've got something written down like most of us might do, and you just put a presentation or create presentation. Now, that itself is a pretty big task. And as that staring at you in the face, it can be overwhelming. *So what I'm going to suggest for you is instead break that down into many smaller pieces and make them as small as you possibly can*. So, for example, you know, maybe your first task is you call boss for suggestions. OK, so that could be a simple first step. Second step could be, you know, start. Outline. Maybe a third step would be to, you know, research. Evidence for whatever your presentation is going to be on, maybe another step would be to create your PowerPoint slides, then after that, maybe we're going to create notes. For each slide. Then we'll practice our overall pitch. In our presentation. And then perhaps we put something down like time, our presentation. *Now, again, this is just an example of what you might use, but the key is to come and break these down into further steps and make them as small as possible, because once you start to break these chunks down, it becomes a lot less overwhelming*. Instead of having this huge, you know, create presentation task staring you in the face. It's easy just to pick up the phone, call your boss, ask for some suggestions, and then, boom, you can come down here, you can cross this off our list, and then you can come to the next step and start your outline. Now, depending upon how overwhelmed you are, the more over overwhelmed your the smaller you need to breakdown each task. The smaller you breakdown each task, the quicker your overwhelm is going to go away and you can start knocking these off one at a time. As we get to later lectures, we're going to go into more detail on how you can combat overwhelm. But for now, what I encourage you to do is look for times when you get overwhelmed as a trigger for your procrastination and start to jot down all your tasks and everything that's in your head on paper. And if it's a complexity issue and if something's too large, break it down into smaller chunks.

==== Failing to Plan - here / bookmark

Our next silent killer of productivity is not having a plan and one of the best ways to just about guarantee yourself to be unproductive and to get poor results is to just wing it. It may sound a little crazy, but in reality, this is exactly what most people do. And if you're honest with yourself, what does your plan look like on a daily basis now without a conscious strategy on how to manage your priorities and invest your time, you are almost certain to get caught up in the current of other people's agendas emails, phone calls and interruptions without a plan. It's incredibly easy to feel busy, but leave the office or go to bed at night wondering what the heck it was that you actually accomplished. There's a multitude of options when it comes to planning your priorities and staying organized. There's your classic to do list. You know, you can use a calendar or in this day and age there seems to be an app for just about anything. What plan or approach you actually use is much less important than the fact that you actually use something. Now, we're going to go into much further detail on future lectures, and I'm going to get you started with a couple of examples. But for right now, let's understand why having a plan is so critical.

The *first* thing that planning is going to do for you is provide clarity now, planning forces you to get clear on what it is you actually want to accomplish. It allows you to really decide how to invest your time and what your most important tasks are. Now, as silly as this sounds, many don't even know. And it sounds simple, I know, but I can't tell you how often when I sit down to write out the three most important tasks that I want to accomplish that day, how frequently I pause and have to really give it some serious thought. This is a really critical first step. Another key benefit of having a plan is the locks you in. And once you lock in to your priorities of the day, it's really going to help you lock out all the distractions and all the things that pop up along the way. They can get you sidetracked. And *lastly*, a plan creates great subconscious accountability. When you've got a system and you've got a plan and you actually write out what your top priorities are for the day, I'm telling you, it will nag at you until you get it done. And I've found that this will at least double your chance of actually completing that task if you commit to it in writing. *Please don't underestimate the power behind this particular advantage, because be honest*, we all love Crosson. Those things off our To-Do list. Now, if you don't consistently plan your week and plan your day and you're not doing that already, your job is to start planning your day and planning your week before the end of this course, I'm going to get into more depth and walk through this in more detail in future lectures. But like Benjamin Franklin said, failure to plan is planning to fail.

==== Waiting for Things to Be Perfect

*Our next silent killer of productivity is waiting for things to be perfect, you see, unproductive people are great at waiting for the time to be right. They're great at waiting until they feel like it, waiting until they're in the mood to get started. The door of opportunity is right there for them to walk through it, but they're waiting for it to open now. Rarely does the perfect time ever come*. Or if it does, you've already been passed by those that just got started. For those people like me that like to overanalyse, think about the pros and the cons predict every possible outcome or what if scenario. You've got to build the habit of just getting started in chemistry. There's a term called activation energy activation. Energy is the minimum energy required to start a chemical reaction. Now that energy is required to start, that reaction far exceeds the energy required to sustain the reaction. But let me give you another example. *So let's take a look at our rocket right here. Now, with the rocket such as this one, there's something called escape velocity. Now, a rocket must reach a speed of about seven miles per second to escape the earth's pull of gravity. But almost all of that energy is needed at the beginning when a rocket first launches. You and I are no different*. In most cases, the hardest part of any task is just getting started. That's why it can be so easy to keep putting something off and putting something off and putting something off. *But the good news is that objects in motion tend to stay in motion and all you need to do to get started is to get started and the rest will usually take care of itself*. Now, what about you? What have you been putting off? What do you need to get started on right now?

==== The Myth of Multi-Tasking

Welcome back. *So this next silent killer of productivity might surprise you is multitasking*. Now, don't get me wrong, in many instances, multitasking is a must in today's environment. And when I use the term multitasking, all I mean is just doing more than one thing at a time. But first, you've got to understand that we don't truly perform tasks in parallel. Multitasking is actually multi switching. Your brain's actually switching from one task to the next and back again. This can happen rather quickly and it may even go so fast that you don't even consciously notice it. But because your brain is switching back and forth, then switching does come at a mental cost. *We're only able to actually focus deeply on one task at a time. In fact, according to one researcher, instead of making you more productive, multitasking can actually double the amount of time it takes you to complete a specific task while also potentially doubling your mistakes. That's a pretty significant mental cost. And to make matters worse, when you get distracted. It takes you almost 15 minutes on average to get fully back in the flow*. Roughly half of our daily interruptions are self-inflicted. This is why in future lectures, I'm going to be talking about modifying our work environment and setting ourselves up to minimize distraction now for important tasks, which are those tasks that require your full focus and attention. Now, those projects that require problem solving creativity, it's critical that you focus 100 percent on one thing at a time and segment out a specific time block where you're only focusing on that critical task in order to produce your best work and get that work done in the shortest period of time. Now, these tiny blocks are incredibly important for maximizing your productivity and for getting your best results. *You've got to turn that phone off, shut off your email alerts and put everything else aside. And just by focusing on your most important task, first, by blocking off that time, specifically where all you focus on is that critical task, you'll see huge results*. Now you can experiment with the length of time block that works best for you. You know me personally, I find that I can focus for about 60 Minutes at a time in most cases before I start to reach that *path of diminishing returns*. For some people, that may be forty five minutes. For some, it may be twenty five. We're going to talk more specifically about how you do this and later lectures. But for right now, I just want you to understand that if you think you're great at multitasking, you're not. Now, if you're doing some really easy, mindless type activities, sure, you can do two things at once, but items that really require your best effort, that really require your focus, your creativity, you've got to set aside time and focus on one task at a time.

==== Time Leaks & Fake Breaks

This next silent killer is kind of a two for one combo, and I'm talking about fake breaks in time leaks and I will explain why these two were married together. We all have time leaks. These are the type of things that we do throughout the day that robs us of our productivity. In many cases, we do this so frequently and it's become such a habit that we don't even realize how this impacts us. I define a time leak as those little things we oftentimes do to give us a break or switch up things between tasks. These can also be items that we focus on when we're procrastinating or just killing time. Now, this slide right here shows you a few of our favorites, things like checking your Facebook page, checking Twitter, surfing the Internet, watching videos on YouTube to emails such a huge culprit in such a big killer that it has its own lecture coming shortly. Our smartphones and our computers are becoming more and more responsible for the vast majority of our time leaks. But that isn't always necessarily the case. Sometimes it can be gossiping with coworkers, shooting the breeze with friends or texting with family members. *Now, you can't fix something until you know exactly where you're going wrong*. So I suggest you take a few days this week and do a time on it. I want you to notice how many times you switch to timeleak activities. If you spend lots of time on your computer, you can use an app like Rescue Time to track your activity for you to see where you're spending your time. Rescue time is a free app and you can directly loaded into your browser and it will track the websites and the different apps and things that you do on your computer and break them into different categories and track your productivity, whether you use an app like Rescue Time or some of the myriad of other options that are out there. The biggest thing is for you just to track how often you're taking these fake breaks or engaging in these time leaks and also to determine how long these activities persist and what your top leaks are. I told you, fake breaks and time leaks were married together. So what is a fake break now? What's you're probably going to find is that many time your time leaks fit into the category of fake breaks or what I call fake breaks. Those fake breaks are when you're looking for a break from a task or whatever it is, your primary project that you're working on. And usually this is by way of the path of least resistance, such as surfing the web or checking apps on your phone. Your instinct is correct. *Your brain and your body does need time to rejuvenate and needs breaks in order to perform this optimal level. But these types of activities, surfing the web, checking your email, looking at your Facebook page, these are fake breaks. They don't actually reset your willpower, reset your focus or help you increase your energy. They're actually making it worse now*. Now, in a later lecture, I'm going to show you how to use pit stops to give yourself real breaks that will actually reset and rejuvenate your brain back to its optimal performance. But for now, what I want you to do is take inventory of your productivity and over the next day or so, track and write down how often you're taking fake breaks and how often you stay sidetracked before you get back on track. And later on in this course, we're going to show you how to use brakes to your advantage.

==== Poor Emotional and Energy Managment

Welcome back. So our next selling killer of your productivity is something that I think many people take for granted, and that's how big an impact your emotional state or energy level plays at any particular time. You see, at any moment you can have a huge influence on how you feel. Another term for that might be mood. You can feel like this guy on the left who's down and out and when you're in a bad mood, are angry, frustrated or sad. How productive are you? How likely are you to attack your priorities and do your best work? Not likely. Now, if you feel like my man on the right, you're much more likely to pick up that phone to make the important phone call without hesitation and dive right into your most important tasks and you're much more likely to be successful. Now, the thing is, for most people, their mood is usually determined by external circumstances. If you're having a bad day, they're in a bad mood. If they're having a good day, they're in a good mood. But it doesn't have to be that way. There are a multitude of strategies at your disposal to influence your mood or emotional state at any given time. How you use your body in any given moment is just one example. *Amy Cuddy is a social psychologist and professor at Harvard Business School, delivered a great TED talk that shows the power of influence we have on ourselves and specifically regarding the way that we use our own body*. *In her studies, she put participants into high powered poses or low power poses for just two minutes now. You'll see over here on the left, we've got our high power poses. This one right here has been dubbed the Wonder Woman Pose. But in each one of these scenarios, you'll see that they're making their body wide and or expanding their stance, and over here on the right hand side, you're going to see low power poses. They're making themselves small or closing their body language. And after just two minutes, they test the participants hormone levels to see if it had any effect. And quite frankly, I found the findings astounding. Now, those who struck the high power pose, so a 20 percent increase in testosterone and a 25 percent decrease in cortisol, cortisol being a hormone most times associated with stress and those that spent two minutes in the low power poses saw a 10 percent decrease in testosterone and a 15 percent increase in cortisol*. These were just subjective question and answers of how a person described that they felt after these situations, but actual hormonal changes. I'm going to go into even more detail in future lectures on how to use this type of stuff to your advantage, where we really get into designing our own blueprint for unstoppable productivity. *But for right now, I just want you to understand the impact that you control over how how you feel in any given moment*. But for right now, I simply want to ask you who's making the decision and how you feel at any given moment. Are you leaving it up to external circumstances, to other people to push your buttons to depend upon what's going on out there in the world? Or are you taking control of how you feel?

==== Email - One of the biggest Silent Killers of Productivity

Email is most likely enemy number one when it comes to killing your productivity. Now, it hasn't taken that long for email to completely change how we communicate and really become an everyday part of how most workers and companies interact. Believe it or not, the first U.S. president to send an email was Bill Clinton, who held office between 1993 and 2001. But in that period of time, how many emails do you think he actually sent during his term? He sent exactly two emails. Since then, its use has exploded. In fact, in one study, almost a third of workers list email as their biggest distraction on the job. Another study found that a typical worker checks their email once every five minutes and then on average, it takes about sixty four seconds to resume the previous task after checking their email. In fact, it's estimated that 70 percent of emails actually interrupt the recipients within six seconds of arriving with all the dinging and alerts going off all day long. It's amazing we get anything that I think Brennan Batard put it best when he said that in many cases, your email inbox a convenient organizing system for other people's agenda. I know I certainly can be guilty of checking email far too often, and many of us will check it first thing in the morning when we wake up. We'll check it all day long and then check it right before we go to bed. Now, I'm not saying that email can't be a great tool for communication or even a necessity, quite frankly, in the workplace. But it's critical that you set up your own rules and restrictions for how often you check your email and used batch processing. Everybody's situation is different, *but I highly encourage you to experiment with different constraints and only allow yourself to check email at designated times throughout the day*. Another great strategy can be to check email when your energy levels are at the lowest. Typically, checking email, sending email is pretty easy work and that will allow you to save your high energy and most productive time periods for your most important tasks. So what about you? What's your relationship with email? Do you check it first thing in the morning? Do you check it all day long? If so, I encourage you to experiment. And over the next day or two, pick two, three or four times max throughout the day that you're allowed to process and check email and only check email throughout those time frames and block off the rest of the time for your highest impact activities and most important priorities.

=== Section 3:

*Time Management vs Self Managment*

Now, we're all very familiar with the term time management, and this is the term that we often use to describe productivity and making the most of our time, but really it's a misnomer or the wrong term to be using. Now, as far as I know, unfortunately, time travel's yet to be invented, nor is there a giant pause button following us around where we can actually stop time whenever we like. *And whether we like it or not, each minute is only made up 60 seconds and each week one hundred and sixty eight hours. And those are going to pass us by at the same speed no matter what we do. And in reality, when we're talking about time management, what we really should be talking about is self-management, because the one and only thing that we have one hundred percent total control over is what we do and how we manage that time*. I hear my clients say things all the time, like I don't have enough time, there's not enough time in the day or man, I wish I could just make more time. And you can wish all you want, but that's going to be a crutch that's going to keep you stuck exactly where you are. *Now, my suggestion is don't wish you had more time. Instead, wish you had better self-management, better systems, better tactics, better habits, and probably most importantly, better execution on the stuff that you already know how to do and actually put it in a play which you already know you should be doing but aren't doing. These are the things that really make a difference. And these are the things that you have. One hundred percent total control over time*. The great equalizer. You and I have just as much time each day, each week and each year as the president, the United States or a CEO of a Fortune 500 company. But here's the thing. *If you don't know how to manage yourself, if you don't know how to set up and actually consistently use the right systems, it wouldn't matter if you could make more time up here. You wouldn't be able to fully take advantage of that extra time. So I'm going to encourage you right from the start to instill a new belief. And it's not about time management. It's about self management and making the most of the time that you already have. Because if you do make the most of that time that you already do have, you're going to double and triple the results that you're getting now*. And I'm going to show you exactly how to do that in these remaining lectures. And you have the power, but it all starts with you. So this lecture leads off this section for a reason, because I can give you all the coolest tips, tricks, strategies, tactics, principles, concepts, but it all begins with you and your management of whatever system and processes that you put in place. So now that we've got that out of the way onto the next lecture.

*Spending Time vs Investing Time*

Welcome back. *Now, one of the biggest mistakes, I think unhappy, broke and unsuccessful people make is in thinking short term versus long term when making decisions*. Do I want to eat this piece of cake or do I want to go to the gym or do I want to save my money? Or do I want to run out and buy that new electronic gadget? When it comes to how we utilize our time is no different. *And most people, myself included in the past, is typically focused on how they're spending their time each day instead of focusing on how they're investing their time*.

*And there's a huge difference now when most people think of time management productivity, it's in regards to getting the maximum number of things done in a day, a week or a year. But I'm going to encourage you to look at it from another perspective. When you invest in something, you hope that will give you a return that's greater than what you invested. For example, if you put five dollars into a stock, you hope to get much more than that, five dollars over time. And I encourage you to look at time the exact same way. Spending your time is about getting things done, investing your time is about setting up systems and delegating tasks that will literally save you hours and create new hours in the future*.

Now, let's look at an example. Let's say you have a task that takes you on average every single week, about five hours. *Now, many people won't take the time to train someone else to do that task or automate that task because it usually requires more effort in the short run*. So let's say in this case, that five hour task would require 20 hours if you were going to take that task, automate it or train someone else to do that task for you. Twenty is much bigger than five. So if you're focused on thinking more for the short term, in the long term, that's four times as long. And you're just going to go ahead and continue to do that task. But let's look at the long term. If you invest that 20 hours, just one time, right. It's a one time investment, you're going to earn back a return of two hundred and sixty hours over the course of a year to be able to use for other tasks. Now, I don't know about you, but I would love to have two hundred and sixty hours back to be able to use over a year. *Many of the people that I speak with, a lot of them have trouble delegating and letting go. But once you understand the difference between spending your time and getting more time back in the future by investing your time, it becomes a real game changer*. This is simply understanding the power of how spending more time today can earn you back more time in the days to come. You are utilizing this very principle by taking this class, and I would call these investments investments that even Warren Buffett would be proud of. And for those of you that aren't familiar with Warren Buffett, he's one of the most successful investors of all time. You'll see from this quote that Warren talks about a complete mind shift regarding investing versus savings. And in this instance, he's talking about money. But the principles are the same. Don't save what's left after spending, but spend what is left after savings. This just comes down to priority. *So focus more on time investing activities that will pay you back each and every single day and are going to make you more and more productive*. Mr. Buffett had another great quote that I love, and it was that investing in yourself is the best thing that you can do. Anything that improves your talents, nobody can ever take away from you. You have a tremendous asset that can return tenfold. This is a critical mindset to understand as we move forward in future lectures in order to be truly as effective as possible and to maximize the time that you have each day. It's all about investing the time today so that you can earn more time for yourself tomorrow. And who said we couldn't add more time to the day with this strategy? Who needs that time machine anyway?

*The Importance of Sleep to Your Productivity*

Welcome back. So let me ask you a question, how much sleep did you get last night? How much sleep do you think you get? And just a normal week. If it's less than seven hours, you're more than likely reducing your productivity and results even more than you think. I track my sleep nightly because I know how important it is. This is an actual screen shot of a 30 day period of time. And you'll notice that over the course of 30 days, my sleep can fluctuate quite a bit. I average about seven hours and 30 minutes a night, which according to Fitbit, which is who I used to track it, that's more than seventy five percent of the population. That's seven hours and 30 minutes is right at about my target because I know with anything less over time, I'm not going to be at my best. In fact, the National Sleep Foundation recommends that the average adult get between seven and nine hours of sleep and to be even more specific, with a tighter window. Daniels Kripke, in another study found that six and a half to about seven and a half hours is the sweet spot for most people. Unfortunately, a recent Gallup poll reported that 40 percent of people get less sleep than that. The sad reality is that when you're sleep deprived, your performance suffers and just about every area. The worst part is that we don't even realize how badly it affects us. *According to the University of Pennsylvania, if you get six hours of sleep per night for two weeks straight, which is a little less probably than you need, your mental and physical performance declines at the same level as if you stayed awake for 48 hours straight.* But here's the kicker. Most don't realize that they're impacted as much as they are. And sleep deprivation attacks focus more than anything else. So you might be able to step up and do certain tasks in the short term, but you won't have the brainpower to steer you back once you lose focus. Now, I'm willing to bet that you use some type of alarm clock to wake you up in the morning. But what about when you go to sleep? I would argue that setting an alarm to go to sleep at night is even more important for me. I wouldn't exactly call myself a morning person. So oftentimes when I get into a movie or a TV show, a book and feel like staying up later than normal, I've learned to ask myself a question. That question is, would I wake up early to perform this activity? So would I wake up an hour earlier than I was planning on getting up to do whatever it is I'm doing in that moment? Now, if the answer is yes, great, carry on. But almost always that answer would be no. You kind of just get in the flow. You kind of lose track of time and you forget about the importance. But usually that simple question, would I wake up an hour early to do this thing? That's usually just enough to remind me that it's not worth it to make sleep a priority, pick that activity up later and to get my butt to bed. Now, if for whatever reason, you just can't get that six and a half to seven and a half hours of sleep every night. *Another solution can be to take what I call a power nap. And most sleep research will suggest to keep it to less than 30 minutes to keep it from interfering with your normal sleep schedules and circadian rhythms. Even something as small as a 20 minute nap has been proven to improve your memory*. In fact, in one study they took two groups of participants. They had one group take a quick nap, another group not take a nap, and they performed at eighty five percent retention rates for those that took naps versus 60 percent that did not. So there seems to also be something with sleep that helps to solidify memories and learning for you students out there. I could go on and on about the importance of sleep, but you didn't enrol in a course on sleep. But just trust me, sleep is critically important and make sure you're getting at least six and a half to seven hours of sleep. But it's best to experiment to find out what your optimal sleep number is. But whatever you do, make it a priority. All the productivity hacks in the world won't make up for you being sleep deprived.

*The Healthiest Energy Drink That Most of Us Have Access to For Free!*

Now, our next lecture is about the healthiest energy drink and no, it's not Red Bull, Monster, whatever else it is that's out there these days or even coffee, but it's something much more readily available and much less expensive. And that's water. Now, dehydration can impair short term memory and the recall of long term memory, as well as focus and energy levels, 70 percent of your body is made up of water, but your brain's about eighty five percent water. The average person in the United States consumes, on average, thirty two ounces of water in a day, according to the Mayo Clinic. But the average person also loses more than 80 ounces of water just through normal activities of the day. Am I making you thirsty yet? *When your brain is fully hydrated, you think faster, you're more focused, you have more creativity and more clarity. But most importantly, you'd be more productive. While your brain only makes up about three percent of your body mass, it actually uses up to 20 percent of the water and nutrients that you take in. And just like with sleep deprivation that we just got done talking about, even small amounts of dehydration can lead to big effects. Just one percent of dehydration can lead to a five percent cognitive decline*. Now, we're not talking about walking across the desert with no water dehydrated. We're talking about just small levels of dehydration because water is so critical to your brain can put you in that brain fog where you're not as alert as you could possibly be. Now, I don't know about you, but I need all the cognitive help I can get. Now, here, just a couple of best practices for you. Now, as you sleep your six or seven hours a night, you're going to wake up instantly being a little bit dehydrated. So I'm going to encourage you, if you don't already, to drink at least 16 ounces of water within 30 minutes of waking up. One estimate that I've seen is to drink half of your body weight in ounces per day. If you weigh one hundred and fifty pounds, that's seventy five ounces. And it can be hard to do without carrying water around with you everywhere that you go. Rarely do I leave the house or not have a glass of water in my office sitting next to me at all times. Now, even though I carry it around with me just about everywhere, I still oftentimes will notice that in the afternoon, nine times out of ten when I hit that little lull is because I haven't had enough water. I will then go fill up a large glass of water and drink it as quickly as possible and fill up a second glass to have over the next hour and most of the time within ten minutes. I'm almost always amazed at the increase in energy that I feel. If you don't believe it, just give it a try. Now, while it is possible for you to drink too much water, if you're like most people, you probably don't drink nearly enough. *If you're not sleep deprived and you don't have as much energy as normal usually is because of dehydration. Start with water and nine times out of ten, that's going to solve the problem. So I'm going to encourage you to drink water early, drink water often and stay hydrated. You'll notice the difference and I promise you'll thank me later*.

*Mastering Your Energy, Mood & Emotional State*

All right, welcome back. I don't think most people realize how much their mood influences, how productive they are and quite frankly, how drastically it affects the actions that they do or don't take as humans. We're all emotional beings. And the emotions that we're feeling at any given moment is going to have a great impact on what we do or don't do. In a previous lecture, we talked about how poor emotional management was one of our silent killers of productivity and how most people's mood is driven by external circumstances. *Now, your number one asset is your energy and emotional state at any given time, if you're tired, worn down, overwhelmed, stressed out or just plain in a bad mood, you can have the greatest tools in the world and understand exactly what it is that you should do. You can even know how to do it, but you still won't actually do it*. Now, the great news is that this is within your control. There are very specific things you can do to put yourself in a great mood and elevate yourself to a productive state at any point in time. If you're primed and ready to go, your task become much easier. If you're in a lousy state or a lousy mood, even the simplest task can seem insurmountable. Now, it's critical that you understand that you are the creator of your experience. Now, what the heck do I mean by that? What I mean is you have the ability at any moment in time to choose what you're focusing on and how you're talking to yourself and the questions that you're asking yourself. This is a great gift of evolution of our brain in that prefrontal cortex or executive function part of our brain that at the end of the day, we are the CEO of our brain and can direct our spotlight to focus accordingly. That, of course, does not actually mean that most people use that power at any given time. *You've got two choices. You can direct your attention to those things that are going well, things that are great in your life, things that are where you want them to be, and things that are within your control. And when you do that, how do you feel? You might feel a sense of gratitude, hope, appreciation and progress. But what if you instead choose to focus on what's missing in your life, what's going wrong, and focusing on all the things that maybe you're going wrong in that are missing, that you can't even control in that instance, how do you feel*? You might feel jealous, angry, sad, disappointed, maybe even depressed. And I'm sure you know or know of people that seem to have it all money, family, you know, a great job, but they're still not happy. In fact, they're miserable and they always want more. And maybe you're one of those people. But I'm also sure that, you know, somebody that doesn't seem to have great external success or have a lot of stuff, but they're at peace, they're happy and they fully embrace all the little things in life. *The thing is, you actually have a choice. And despite your external circumstances, you can choose where to put that spotlight of your focus and attention in any given moment*. And don't get me wrong, I'm not saying it's always easy, but it is within your power. #*The tough part is that most of our thoughts and behaviors are habits, the things that we do and thoughts that we think over and over again without even really giving it any conscious thought. So over time, you've developed automatic patterns and you habitually lean towards thinking one way or the other*#. Do you know which one? The good news is that we can create new habits at any point in time and you are in control, you can decide what you want to focus on and that becomes a very powerful weapon. But just make sure that you're using that weapon for good once you focus on is just one piece of the puzzle. *Another major contributor to your mood is how you're using your body at any given moment. As I mentioned in that earlier lecture, studies have shown that something as simple as how you use your body posture and have a hormonal effect specifically as it relates to testosterone and cortisol*. Now, this information is taken from Amy Cutty's TED Talk titled Your Body Language Shapes Who You Are. And on the left, you're going to notice that we have three examples of high power poses. Standing with a wide base, with your arms on your side, standing in front of a table again, taking up space or even sitting down, putting your arms behind you and legs out participants who held one of those. What they did power poses for two minutes. So a 20 percent increase in their testosterone, which is the confidence hormone in a twenty five percent decrease in cortisol, often called the stress hormone to the right, you're going to see what they deem low power poses. You see all the way over to the right, you see the gentleman that's holding his neck, folding his arms in the middle or sitting down, making making themselves small, putting your hands in your lap. Those that performed a low power pose again for only two minutes saw a 10 percent decrease in testosterone and a 15 percent increase in the stress hormone cortisol. I'll leave a link for you in the resources so you can check out the entire TED talk in the entire presentation.

But let's not overcomplicate it. When you're confident and you feel a great sense of power and certainty, how do you hold your body, your heads up high, your body is expansive, your shoulders are back, and you have power in the core or middle of your body. Now, when you're sad, depressed or feeling weak, how do you hold your body in that situation? Your heads typically down, your body's more collapsed and you're making yourself feel small. I think that many people understand that your mind can have an effect on how you carry your body. If you're in a great mood, you can carry yourself confident and hold your body in a certain way. If you're in a bad mood, it can cause you to carry your body another way.*But I don't think people realize that your body can also change your mind. That means how you're using your body in any given moment can have a huge impact on how you're feeling, which then is going to impact your productivity to a great deal*. So let's circle back and really bring this home. Go back to the time when you met your spouse for the first time, or think about someone that you've met early on in a relationship and you are in love, just totally infatuated with that person. All is right with the world, right. It permeates all areas of your life. And in this emotional state, nothing can go wrong. If you lose your job, that's OK. I'll find another one. We still have each other. That's all that matters. You're walking on air and ready to take on the world. What about some time when you've really been down, maybe you experienced some type of colossal failure or someone rejected you. You received some horrible news when you get really down, really sad or even depressed when you're in that mood, how much do you feel like doing anything? It can be hard to even get out of the house. If you're going to truly take control of your productivity and really take it to the next level, you must take control of your mood in the right mood. You can be unstoppable, in the wrong mood. You'll be stuck in quicksand. The best productivity tool or hack can't override it. You need to focus on this first. If you have a big project or task, focus on your mood. First, put your focus in the right area, take a walk, do some deep breathing, put on your favorite song or strike a power pose for two minutes. *Do whatever it takes to put yourself in the right emotional state or mood. You will increase your productivity times ten*. Give it a try and you'll be the master of your moves, not the other way around.

*How Will Power Really Works*

Welcome back when they're procrastinating. I know many of my clients wrongfully think that they just need to use more willpower or that is willpower that's letting them down when they fail, when you're dealing with productivity. I think it's critical to really understand how willpower works. First, what do I mean by willpower? Now, one definition is the ability to utilize self-control or the ability to get yourself to do something. Oftentimes something is difficult. Don't we all just wish we were robots and could kill ourselves instantly to avoid that cookie, eat our vegetables and go to the gym. But how does willpower really work? Now, I've heard many people who study willpower describe it like a muscle, and I think that's a great analogy. So just like a biceps muscle or any other muscle, if you're lifting weights in the gym, you can only lift a weight for so long. Now, the lighter the weight, the more reps you might be able to complete. But the heavier the weight, the fewer reps you'll be able to complete. Either way, at some point, that muscle is going to give out and you're going to need some type of rest and recuperation in order for it to begin lifting weights. Again, your willpower is very similar. You have a certain reservoir of real power that you have available to you. But once you use that up, you become very susceptible to short term urges or emotions, even if you know it's not good for you. Procrastination, anyone. This is why you might look at those cookies sitting on your kitchen table and say no and hold yourself back eight times. But finally, later on in the day, boom, you cave and scarfed down three cookies in about five seconds. Or is that just me? Let's look at some real world implications and where willpower and the example of willpower can have even more serious consequences in their book, Willpower. Roy Baumeister and John Tierney hope I pronounce their name OK, shared some research done by psychologists who monitored the decisions that judges made when deciding the fate of whether or not to release prisoners who were up for parole. The judges averaged releasing about one out of every three prisoners. But there was a really interesting twist. Prisoners who appeared in the morning got paroled about sixty five percent of the time, while prisoners who appeared late in the afternoon got paroled about 10 percent of the time. Another interesting discovery. After a meal break, the judges became more generous again for a short period of time and awarded parole to most of the prisoners. Now, in the book, they discussed decision fatigue in this very concept of willpower. What is the riskier decision for these judges? Is it letting a prisoner out or keeping them in jail? If these judges are on the fence, the least risky decision is going to say no to the parole and to put them back in prison. And in the book, they describe exactly what's going on. *Their willpower is that their greatest early in the morning when they were given parole about sixty five percent of the time, as they're making those decisions, the willpower is getting depleted. You'll see that after meal time or when they took a break and came back and were able to replenish that reservoir, a little bit more people would get parole. But as they started to experience that decision, fatigue and their willpower depleted. Unfortunately for those prisoners that were up for parole, they receive parole much less frequently than when their willpower was at its highest*. Doesn't only impact judges. We're all human. Successful people and productive people know this about willpower, and they structure their systems and structure their day around this fact, whether it's tackling their most important item first thing in the morning, would they have the most willpower? *And before they start to eat away at that with decision fatigue or whether it's saving the easy work or things that require less willpower, like returning emails for the afternoon when they know that willpower will be more depleted, or if they set up their work in such a way that utilizes systems and habits so they don't have to use willpower at all*. The good news is that just like a muscle, the more you exercise your willpower, the bigger that willpower muscle gets. Now, eating the right foods, getting enough sleep, staying hydrated and taking breaks can help you to recharge your willpower. And these are all things we've talked about in previous lectures. But you must understand that your willpower and your self-control is just like a muscle used up over time. And if you run it too fast, you run it too hard. You're only setting yourself up for failure. So make sure you strengthen that willpower muscle and use it to your advantage.

*Knowing and Doing Are Completely Different Things*

Now, there's one key above all others on whether or not this course will actually work for you, and that comes down to execution. Simply put, will you actually use the concepts and ideas in this course? I'm sure some of these ideas you've heard before, but common sense is not common practice. When you say to yourself, I already know that it's just you down, but in fact, you're asking the wrong question. Am I already doing this is the question you should be asking. Am I actually doing it consistently? Because only then will you get the benefits or the results from it. Otherwise, you might as well not even know the information. It all comes down to execution. *Give me a mediocre idea that's flawlessly executed and I will win every single time over a genius idea that never gets off the ground. Now, most people love to put their focus on the latest and greatest thing, the new idea, the sexy idea. But those that execute the fundamentals actually get the best results*. There will be some ideas in this course that I'm sure you've heard before, but I know that already is the biggest enemy of learning. You don't truly know it unless you're flawlessly executing it. There's a difference. *Now, I'm sure you've heard the term knowledge is power, but I disagree. I don't think knowledge really is power. I truly believe that knowledge is potential power, potential power, but only power, if actually acted upon and used that real power comes from its application or execution because without action, there's no results*. And most are just looking for that magic pill, that microwave solution. But unfortunately, it doesn't work that way. It's not good enough to understand something intellectually. And this is where most people stop. There's a bridge between understanding something or knowing something intellectually and really doing it and applying it. It requires that next step. Now, you only need to implement one idea from this course to make it worth your time and money. But many people learn and few people act because what you know doesn't really matter. It's what you do with that knowledge on a consistent basis that's going to determine your results. So what are you going to do now? I strongly encourage you to look at your notes so far and decide which concepts are most critical for you and which ones you're going to implement and decide how you're going to implement them right now and start today. Now, in the next section of this course, we're going to jump into some specific tactics to take your productivity to the next level. But none of them are going to work. That is, none of them will work without you actually putting them into play on a consistent basis, day in, day out. In this course, I encourage you to take what works for you and leave the rest. But please apply your knowledge and take action and put these fundamentals into play. See you in the next section.

=== Section 4:

*The Warren Buffet Productivity Secret*

I think one of the best ways to get better results is to model with the ultra successful people do sustain success is never one hundred percent luck. That just happens to people. Those who are really successful always leave a trail of clues. They simply approach things differently than the rest of us. Now, I mentioned Warren Buffett in a previous lecture and in a previous section, but I want to come back to him one more time. And just as a reminder, he's worth more than 60 billion dollars, and that's with a B and as one of the most successful investors of all time. *So what's his secret? His secret is simply saying, no. This is a quote from Mr. Buffett. The difference between successful people and really successful people is that really successful people say no to almost everything is sounds too simple, doesn't it? I mean, we can all pronounce the word no. We all know how to say it, but just about all of us don't say it enough. Maybe you're a people pleaser and you want to help others. Or maybe you're ambitious and want to tackle it all*. Or maybe you're like my wife and you just have foma fear of missing out. Either way, if you're overwhelmed, this is the place to start. Scott Densmore wrote a great article about a story that he was told to by a friend of his. His friend was a pilot for Warren Buffett at the time. And one day Warren went up to his pilot and jokingly said, the fact that you're still working for me tells me I'm not doing my job. *You should be out there going after more of your goals and dreams were and then asked the pilot to make a list of his top twenty five priorities or goals just to write them all down on a piece of paper*. So I threw out a couple of examples right here on this slide to mimic a little bit of what the pilot went through to jot down some of the top priorities and goals that he might have had once the list was complete. *Warren asked the pilot to review the list and circled the top five that were most important. And those top five, that would make the biggest impact, the ones that he prioritized over everything else. And he insisted he could choose only five*. So let's say, for example, that these were the five. That he chose to enroll in school, you know, maybe take the family to Disney World, see lose 20 pounds and create a website. And moved to Texas, who doesn't want to move to Texas now after these top five were selected, *Warren asked him to create a plan for accomplishing all five*. There's nothing earth shattering in this yet, right? Pretty standard stuff. But after they went on to discuss how he was going to accomplish the top five items, Buffett asked the pilot what he planned to do with the remaining 20 items. What are your plans for those? The pilot said, well, those 20 are a close second to my top five, and they're still very important to me. So I'll work on them intermittently as I have time while I'm working on my top five items. *Wrong answer. Warren said that those other 20 items are now his avoid at all costs list. No matter what, those things get absolutely no attention until he'd succeeded with the other five*. Now that right there is the magic, the power of focus and saying no and you will hear all the really successful people talk about it. Now, many of us have a to do list, #*but how many of us have a not to do list*#? Think about the difference in clarity and focus when you have tunnel vision on your top priorities and nothing else, and this is critical not only for your goals, but for your daily activities as well, potential distractions will only increase with new technology. And as you become more and more successful, those are never going to go away. You will need to become more and more successful and skilled as saying no. So you might as well start exercising that muscle now. So let me ask you. What's in your top five? I encourage you to perform the exact same exercise using the page and the resources, write down and just get it all on paper, your top twenty five goals and dreams and really sit down and circle the top five. The most critical five is going to give you 80 percent of your results and take you where you want to go.

*The First and Most Technique*

Now, in the previous lecture, we talked about saying no and getting clear on your top priority items, this next lecture is complementary to that approach and that's no matter what. #*Start your day with focused effort on your most important, highest value and highest impact activity. Now, here's a way you might go about figuring out what that task is, and you can ask yourself what is the one thing that if you accomplished it today, would make your day a success and would make everything else that follows easier*#. Now, remember, forget about whether you've heard this before. That's the wrong way to think about it. Are you doing this consistently day in, day out? And if you're like 90 percent of my clients and in my opinion, 90 percent of the people out there, the answer is no. What about you? What did you start your day with today? What did you start your day with yesterday? Most people I work with and I'm guilty of this many times as well, start their day by checking email. It's easy and it's a habit. *But when you're checking email, it's easy to get pulled into other people's agendas, fires and priorities before you know it. An hour or two of your most productive time has been lost in email, which is rarely the best use of your time.* Don't worry, those email messages are still going to be waiting for you later on in the day. But you have to understand that your first 90 minutes needs to be laser focused on what is most critical to your business and your results. Here's the hard part and the number one reason why most people don't do it. That most important task, the one most critical to your results, is usually the one that you're avoiding and the one that you don't want to do. And the longer you put it off, the more difficult it is to get started. But there's numerous reasons why this is key. When you have that item on your list that you keep avoiding, it nips at you all day long. You know what's there. You know, you should be working on it. And that comes with the psychological cost. Instead, when you blast through your most important item right off the top, it sets the tone for the day and it gives you that sense of accomplishment and a blast of energy and endorphins. It actually propels you forward and makes your remaining task much easier. You start with that momentum and you carry it through with the rest of the day. Please don't underestimate the power of this simple tactic. *What I want you to do is decide the night before, before you leave the office, decide what your most important, highest priority task is for the next day and schedule it on your calendar first day, then make it a personal rule and a habit to attack that first thing no matter what*. Turn off your technology, close your door and set a timer for 90 minutes and get into a state of flow working on that singular task until it's complete. You'll be amazed at what a game changer that can be for your productivity and more importantly, your results.

*Your Productivity Secret Weapon*

Welcome back. *Now, for most people, it can be easy to get stuck in a reactive mode where we're moving from task to task based on what is most urgent, but most urgent is really most important. In fact, many activities that could have a huge impact are not urgent and thus can be easy for us to never start, whether it be starting a business, going to the gym, prospecting for new clients or spending time with family. We all have items that we feel are important that we'd like to get to, but never seem to*.

#*The biggest challenges with many of these tasks is that they lack a deadline*# and we'll talk more about that later in a future lecture. But without a deadline, it's easy to continue to put off these tasks. Now, when it comes to time management productivity, people typically use to tools in some form or another. These are, of course, a to do list and a calendar. Now, whether you use an app, a hard copy planner or just a piece of paper and pencil, to some degree you have some type of calendar or to do list or at least I hope you do. You must understand, however, that we use these tools and treat them drastically different. Your to do list can oftentimes become a dumping ground for all the things that need to get done. *And many will jot down not only the important, but includes some of the smaller, less important tasks as well. And when that happens many times in order to feel productive, you tackle the smaller tasks so you can cross them off the list. And let's not kid ourselves. We love crossing things off our list. It gives us a sense of progress, but those smaller, less important tasks are never going to lead to big results*.

Now, let's talk about your calendar. This is where you record your appointments, are tasked with the specific time and a specific day. And there's a huge difference between your to do list and your calendar. Now, unlike your to do list, that becomes your dumping ground, you will defend and protect what gets put on your calendar and what gets scheduled. It requires an extra step. You must go to your calendar, determine if you already have something scheduled or conflict, and you must decide if it's important enough to add to that calendar. We are all much more protective of what we'll put in our calendar than we are what we'll put on our To-Do list. *For most people, our inbox will never be empty and we'll never fully get caught up on life, small and urgent tasks. So technically, if we don't schedule our biggest proactive priorities, they'll never get done. And that's exactly why what gets scheduled gets done*. Your calendar is your secret weapon. When something's important, schedule it and defend it against distractions and the less important minor tasks, whether you use a planner, a calendar on your computer, on your phone, or a piece of paper and a whiteboard, it doesn't matter. Find what works for you and use it. *Schedule time for your goals and your most critical tasks*. So let me ask you, what do you need to schedule and make a priority right now?

*Using Parkinson's Law to Your Advantage*

Welcome back. *So a British historian and author made a declaration that since been come to be known as Parkinson's law in honor of his last name, and that observation was that work expands to fill the time available for completion, to put it simply, that our tasks swell in perceived importance and complexity in relation for the amount of time that we give for its completion. And this is one of the reasons behind the magic of the imminent deadline*.

*If I give you twenty four hours to complete a lengthy assignment, the pressure of that short deadline will force you to focus on execution and the bare necessities. You will get laser like focus and block out all distractions and you'll become incredibly productive.*

*But if I were to give you a week to complete that exact same task, you will take six days to make it a bigger deal, overanalyse, procrastinate and deliberate. Without aggressive deadlines, we all grow minor tasks and make the unimportant important, thus wasting valuable time*.

*I'm sure you can think of more than a few examples when you were really up against a wall and up against an aggressive deadline, maybe even a deadline that you felt was unreasonable. But if you went for it, I'm certain you figured out a way to achieve it. Now, many of us are actually pretty good at meeting deadlines, that is other people's deadlines, but don't fully utilize this principle to create our own deadlines. You must set aggressive deadlines to focus your energy and efforts. It will keep you from just being active and busy without actually being productive and getting results. It'll stop you from inventing things to do in order to avoid those really important tasks. You'll be surprised how quickly you can complete certain tasks once you've had fun with this and put it to the test. So how do we apply this in everyday life? I'm going to challenge you to race against the clock for your next project estimate. How long you think that project will take. You just give it your best guess. Now take that time and cut it by a third and challenge yourself to complete it in that new time frame and treat it like any other deadline. This can be an especially great strategy for those mundane, boring tasks and is a great way to not only get them completed faster, but it will also spice it up and lets you have a little bit of fun with it. We all love a good challenge competition or a game. Next time you get into your email, instead of allotting some undetermined amount of time, set a timer and allow yourself to check email only for that length of time. You'll be amazed at how quickly you can process your email in this fashion. Continue to play with your time allotments until you have a true understanding of how quickly you can complete a task when you're really giving it your all. I highly encourage you to challenge yourself with aggressive deadlines, to really take your productivity to the next level.*

*How to Use Daily Themes to Enhance Your Productivity*

OK, so this next lecture is a unique idea I picked up that was inspired by *Jack Dorsey, the co-founder of Twitter and CEO of Square*. Now Square produces those portable little credit card readers for mobile devices, and that company has recently been valued at six billion dollars. I'm sure you can imagine how busy he is and the amount of items that he has to deal with on a daily basis. But what's most impressive to me about him is that he was running both of these companies at the same time. So what's his secret?

*He gives each day of the week a theme so that he can assure that he's not just putting out fires all day and working only on the urgent tasks, but he's working on those things that will really have an impact on the results of both companies*. Now, since he's running both companies at the same time, he found that spending one day a week on products for both companies and one day a week for management of both companies, allowed him to stay focused and away from all the typical distractions.

*Now, this strategy helps you be intentional on what you're focusing on, but also utilizes the power of batching activities. Batching is simply a type of time management strategy that groups similar tasks that require similar resources together in order to streamline their completion in the most efficient way possible. Now, bashing or using theme days minimizes distraction because it keeps your focus narrow. You're only focused on one item or theme at a time. It also allows you to get into the flow much more easily and be efficient with your resources*.

Now, why am I batching be helpful? In an article in the *Harvard Business Review, Peter Bregman notes that our productivity goes down by 40 percent when we try to focus on several things at once. In addition to batching, setting a theme to your day really allows you to make sure that you're putting in enough time on the important high value activities that are really going to give you your best results*. For instance, investing in yourself can give you one of the biggest returns, but many people never get to it. But if one of your days is for personal development and learning, it will help you make a conscious focus and effort to read, take classes, attend webinars and work on sharpening your score. It will make sure that you actually set aside the time to do it. Maybe you don't run to companies like Jack does, but you can still tailor this to your needs. Now, if you're an entrepreneur, maybe it looks something like this. Monday is focused on following up with customers and clients. Tuesday is all about staff development. Staff check in and training. Wednesday is sales and marketing. Thursday, you're working on accounting and finance related activities and Friday is your day for goals and planning. Saturday is all about leisure and having fun with your family. And then Sunday is a day of rest and rejuvenation to prepare you for the week ahead. Now, if you're in sales, maybe Monday is prospecting Tuesdays, following up on current clients Wednesdays for appointments and face to face meetings, Thursday for follow up in delivery and Fridays for training. Now your situation is unique. So I encourage you to play with this strategy, create your own individual themes that would work best for you, experiment and have fun with it. Use it as a way to increase your focus and make sure you're allotting time for your most important areas.

*Resurrecting Your Dead Time*

Welcome back. So this next topic is one that I don't think many people take full advantage of, and that is resurrecting your dead time now throughout our day. We all have dead time here and there. That often goes completely wasted for many of us. Our commute time to and from work is one of the biggest examples. The average commute time to and from work is almost an hour for most people. Now, many people spend this time literally killing time, such as listening to music, talking on the phone, etc.. Now, while our commute time might be the biggest chunk of dead time that we have on a daily basis, there's plenty of other examples. It could be things like waiting in line, taking a shower, eating meals if you're eating by yourself or attending unnecessary conference calls. Now, I want you to take a second to think about how you kill your dead time currently. Is it via your smartphone, surfing the web, checking social media like Facebook or Twitter or using other nonproductive items? It's all right if that's the case, but maybe you've never thought about it before. But I encourage you to over the next day or so, watch how you use your dead time. Now, time for all of us is a non-renewable resource, and we only have a little more than ten thousand minutes each week. And each minute could be very beneficial if we use it the right way. Many people have a desire to read more books, but they complain that they don't have enough time. Why not turn your commute into Automobile University? The average length of an audio book can vary, but if you listen to audiobooks only on your commute to and from work instead of music or radio or doing something else, you could probably get through two books a month on average. Now, if you're a runner or you go to the gym, if you listen to audio books while you exercise, you could easily get through three or four. Not only do you get to learn during this dead time, but I've found that a great book has the added benefit of making the commute go by much faster, or dare I say, even something that you can look forward to. Now, here's some other ideas for some of the dead time that may be a little bit smaller than your commute while waiting in line, you could review your calendar and plan out your week and schedule blocks of time for your biggest priorities. You could use your time in the shower for mindset, priming, gratitude, exercises and mentally preparing yourself for the day. You could use stoplights or waiting in line as a chance to do some deep breathing to reset your brain, you can batch phone calls for other dead times, record notes on your phone, review your goals, or watch motivational videos. Now, the amount of dead time each one of us has every day varies. But I promise you, is there every single day now, how are you using your dead time currently? What could you be using it for? I strongly encourage for you to be proactive and take control of that dead time. Those minutes add up over time to become hours and even weeks and days as time goes on.

*Don't Break The Chain - The Jerry Seinfeld Strategy*

All right, and this next lecture, we're going to talk about not breaking the chain, Jerry Seinfeld is one of the most successful comedians of all time, both as a standup comedian and for his incredibly popular show, Seinfeld. In fact, according to Forbes magazine, Seinfeld made almost two hundred and sixty million dollars back in 1998 and has an estimated net worth of eight hundred million dollars in twenty seven. Brad Isaac wrote an article that he claims was inspired by a conversation he had with Jerry in a comedy club while Isaac was doing open mic nights. He asked Jerry backstage if he had any tips for a young comic like himself. *His advice was quite simple. He said the way to become a better comic is to create or write better jokes, and the best way to do that is to write every single day. He suggested Isaac get a large wall calendar that has an entire year on one page and hang it where he would see it every single day. Then he said, get a big red magic marker. And every day that Isaac writes, he gets to cross off that particular day after a few days. He said, you'll have a streak or a chain going. Your job is to just keep writing every day and that chain will continue to grow. That chain will drive you. And your only job is to not break the chain.* I thought this was really insightful. I think it's easy to just assume that someone like Jerry is this creative genius and that things just come easily and naturally to him. *But Jerry knows that there's no substitute for doing the work*. I'm sure not every joke he created was funny, but he created enough jokes and had the volume to create the jokes that we all remember. He did the work consistently. Now I've heard similar things spoken or written by other creative people who produced really great work. *They get inspired by doing the work. They don't wait to be inspired. They do the work. And the inspiration comes. Jerry and many successful artists and successful people like him don't wait until they're in the mood or they're motivated. It doesn't matter if they feel like it. They simply do the work and don't break the chain*. Speaking of creative artists or writers, Stephen King's books have sold more than three hundred and fifty million copies. But he doesn't wait for inspiration either. Check out this quote. *There are certain things I do. If I sit down to write, I have a glass of water or a cup of tea. There's a certain time I sit down from eight to eight. Thirty a.m. in the morning. Somewhere within that half hour, I have my vitamin pill, my music. I sit in the same seat and the papers are all arranged in the same places. The cumulative purpose of doing these things the same way every day seems to be a way of saying to my mind, you're going to be dreaming soon*. Now, what he's describing here not only is his routine, but a similar philosophy of not breaking the chain. He doesn't wait until he comes up with a great idea. It's a consistent, everyday thing that starts between eight and eight thirty every morning. And he went on to say, *I write when I'm motivated, but it just so happens I'm motivated every day at eight a.m..* Now, you may not be a writer or a comedian or an artist, but to get the results, whatever results you're looking for, you have to be willing to do the work consistently and you must stay focused on the process. So I challenge you right now to pick a task that, you know would be a game changer for you, something that you need to be doing every day, maybe even one that you've been putting off or doing an inconsistently start today. Make your calendar, get your marker, put an X every day when you create that task. And whatever you do, don't break that chain

*Utilizing Pit Stops for High Performance*

*Now, when it comes to productivity, the goal for most people is to get the most stuff done and many will push themselves too hard in the pursuit of that thinking that the more hours they spend, the more results they'll produce. The reality is that sometimes you can get better results and accomplish more by working less. Now, your brain is the biggest asset you have in your quest of productivity and time management, and many of us are handicapping it and locking up as full potential by overloading it and running it too hard for too long without legitimate breaks or pit stops to get it back to its top speed*.

*I used to be this guy too. I bring my lunch to work every day so that I don't have to waste my time taking a break. I can just keep going. I would push and push and push limiting my breaks because I felt like I couldn't afford to lose out on those two minutes or five minutes.*

But let me give you an analogy that I think is appropriate in this scenario. Let's take a look at a race car. These are incredibly high performance machines. In a typical race, if you were to try to finish the race without stopping, you would run out of gas well before you reach the finish line. Every car needs to take pit stops to change tires, make adjustments and to fill up with gas. Now, these stops only take a few seconds because they have 11 people who are executing it in tandem. But there are a crucial investment that keeps the car running at tip top shape and allows the race car to finish the race in the shortest period of time. Your performance in your brain is no different. *It can't run at one hundred percent non-stop without losing some of your creativity, focus, problem solving ability and processing power*. It requires pit stops just like a high performance race car, but not just any type of brake. Not all brakes or pit stops are created equal. And this is where I used to go wrong. *I used to consider anything that was outside of my main task brake being that I work on a computer most of the day. Oftentimes those brakes constituted going to different websites, checking email or looking at social media. But these are really fake brakes. They don't sharpen the knife and don't reset your brain to full strength. It only adds to the problem*. Now, Sean A. in his book The Happiness Advantage, talks about how the brain at a positive state is thirty one percent more productive than a negative, neutral or stressed. Now, that's a huge advantage. *It's not stress that's your enemy you're designed to handle. That is the lack of recovery from stress that causes people problems. Your brain is not designed to be pushed and pushed and pushed without recovery time. So what type of brakes do we need every 90 to one hundred and twenty minutes. You need to take a break. When you get completely away from what you've been working on, leave the scene, take a walk and go one hundred percent technology free. If you have the opportunity and weather permits, get outside, get some fresh air and take a walk. A break as small as ten minutes, but done in the right way can be enough to reset your brain and willpower to make you twice as productive when you return. Use this time also to get another large glass of water to make sure you're keeping yourself hydrated. Remember, the brain's made up of eighty percent water. Now, these breaks are particularly critical in the afternoon when your circadian rhythms as lowest point and I know many will hit that afternoon lull. But if you stay hydrated, get outside, take a walk, get some fresh air and reset your brain, you can limit this drop and be just as productive as you were in the morning*.

*Now, when I started to schedule these breaks and really hold myself accountable to them, I was astonished at the results. It really gave me a second wind that allowed me to power through the rest of my day. Some days I need an additional break, but I can feel when I start to wear down and instead of surfing the web, procrastinating, working on all those little tasks that don't add much value or getting stuck in email, I invest those ten minutes to take a really quality break that allows me to get right back on track. It's a great way to clear your mind*. If you're still not convinced, understand that when you're taking these breaks and you're letting your brain go free, your brain is actually still working this down. Time allows your brain to consolidate recently acquired knowledge and rehearse recently learn skills, your brain still quite active. But this downtime allows it to also continue processing freely. And many times this is when your AHA moments or inspiration will start to pop up. These breaks can turn out to be some of your most productive and creative time. I don't care who you are. There's only so long that you can focus on a task before you start to. Experience diminishing returns, the amount of time can be different for everyone, so I encourage you to start experiment with your sweet spot before you need to break. Maybe it's forty five minutes or an hour or 90 minutes. And sometimes this can depend on how draining the actual activity is that you're working on. I found that I can get more done with better quality in 90 minutes than I was previously accomplishing in three hours. My energy levels better and I have a sense of urgency that greatly improves my focus. So give it a shot, implement some strategically placed pit stops into your day and really take your productivity to the next level. Now, if this is new to you, I'm going to suggest that you set a timer or a reminder throughout the day to make sure that you're taking these breaks until it becomes a habit.

*How to Effectively Use a To Do List*

Now, in this next section, we're going to talk about effectively using it to do list the to do list, action list, priority list, daily plan, whatever you want to call it, is probably the least sexy solution there is. It might even make you yawn, but hang with me. It is, if used correctly, an essential tool in a very necessary tool. You must realize that your working memory is like a Post-it note with disappearing ink. It's got limited storage and that storage only stays with you for about 10 to 15 seconds. Now, that is not an effective tool to manage your priorities. Now, many people used to do lists, but I think most of them utilize them in the wrong way, using it as their dumping ground for all of the things that need to get done, which can lead them to be even more overwhelmed. In this lecture, I want to give you an effective way to use your to do list that actually reduces overwhelm and allows you to get the results that you want. First and foremost, the most important thing to do with the to do list is to get it out of your head. This is a critical first step to help reduce overwhelmed, usually one of the biggest reasons we get overwhelmed because our brain is racing with all the things we need to get done. Our brain thinks it's doing us a favor by reminding us of all of the tasks over and over again. But when you get it out on paper and account for it, it shows your brain that you've got it. It's accounted for and that helps to reduce all those open loops and overwhelm. Now, with today's technology, you've got a multitude of options. You could use something like *any do*, which is an app for both iPhone and Android. It allows cinching and allows you to break tasks into today, tomorrow, this week or later, which will get to hear in a moment. It's also very easy to set up reminders. Another option is *wonder list* for both desktop and mobile phones. You have a myriad of features. You can create folders, share lists with family members or business partners, add reminders, due dates, notifications and directly import from all over the Web. If you're looking for a very feature rich, sophisticated option, you might go check this one out further. But for many people, complexity is the enemy of execution. And you might just want to keep it simple. But whatever works best for you, Evernote is one of my personal favorites, although I use it for much more than just to do lists. I like to call it my digital brain. Now, I could do an entire course on all the features and benefits of Evernote, but here you'll see a screenshot of a sample to do list. But Evernote does much more than that. You can capture notes, whether handwritten, that you scan in or typed up through the platform. You can clip articles directly from the web. You can email directly to its scan business cards, you name it. If you haven't heard about Evernote or you've never tried it before, I do encourage you to check out their website. There's free versions and paid versions, but for most people, the free version is plenty powerful and will do more than enough that you needed to do for. My personal solution for to do this, call me old fashioned, but I prefer the old school pen and paper. And if I'm dealing with stuff that's a little bit more longer term, I'll use my whiteboard. But I find that actually writing things down with a pen is even more effective at releasing things from my brain and allows me to account for it. Plus, just to be honest, I love crossing things off my list. Now I work in an office most days, so using this little pad that you see here on the screen and using a pen and paper option works really well for me, for others. You know, if you're constantly on the go and you need a more portable option, you might want to look at one of the solutions earlier and utilize something that has sync capabilities and you can bring with you on your smartphone. But regardless of whatever you use, here are some of my best practice suggestions. Number one, you've got to write it all down. Whether you're physically writing it down with pen and paper or writing it down on your phone or an app, you've got to get it out of your head and write it down. Now, most people stop with number one. They write it all down, and now they've got this big, huge list and they're overwhelmed. But the critical second step is to filter it. Once you've written it all down, you've got to decide what's highest priority, what needs to be done, what can be delegated, what can be deferred to a later date and what can be dumped altogether. Next, you need to assign a time frame for those things that you haven't delegated, dumped or deferred. You must create a time frame because remember what gets schedule gets done. So assign that time frame and put it on your calendar. Number four, work only off today's list. You'll notice on my particular piece of paper I've got it limited to five items. That's by design. This is my daily list. And I found that. If I get more than five or six items on my list, it's unreasonable, I want to stick with what I can get done that day and what's highest priority that particular day. And I used to have this big, huge, massive to do list and it would overwhelm me. Now I work only off today's list and today's priorities because with step number five, I've got a separate parking lot. I've still got a list of all those items I need to get completed for things that aren't for today. So I've got a parking lot and a separate list that I can refer back to if I get everything accomplished that day. But it's also particularly useful as I'm scheduling my next day. So that parking lot helps me know that I've got it written down, accounted for, but it's in a separate location, so I'm not constantly looking at it and overwhelming myself all day long. So that's it. Write it down, filter it, assign a time frame, work only off today's list, create a parking lot for everything else and repeat that throughout the day. And at the end of the day, when you're scheduling your activities for the next day or if you plan your day first thing in the morning, if you keep it simple and use this consistently, you'll not only get things done, but you'll get the right things done without being overwhelmed. So I encourage you to experiment, whether it be with paper and pen, using apps, using your phone, using a planner, whatever it is, find what works for you. And regardless of whichever route you choose, just make sure you utilize it consistently day in, day out.

*Make Everyday the Day Before Vacation*

Now, how's this for a fun lecture title, make every day, like the day before vacation? In a previous lecture, we talked about the importance of rest and rejuvenation to your productivity and vacations are a great way to take a break, relax and decompress. They've been proven to be well worth the time investment. On a side note, these effects from vacation typically wear off in about. So you usually better off taking shorter, more frequent vacations than one long extended vacation once a year, but for this lecture, we're coming at it from another angle. I'm going to talk to you about the day before you leave for vacation. And really, it's all about your mindset. I've found that I seem to produce more results and get more done on the day before I leave for vacation than any other day of the year. And I think there's a couple reasons for this. When I know I've only got eight to 10 hours to wrap up any loose ends before I'm going to be out of the office, it gives me laser like focus. I want to walk away from work knowing that I left no loose ends so I can fully relax on the beach with my corona. I start the day knowing I must get results and there's no tomorrow to push things off to. This focus takes my productivity to an entire new level. It keeps me from getting caught up in all the everyday distractions. You want to stop by my office and chat about the game yesterday? I would love to, but sorry, not today. I got stuff to do. It's amazing how little time I have for distractions on those days and the fact that I have vacation tomorrow gives me a built in excuse. But you don't need an excuse to say no on every other day. Just let Mr. Distractor or Mrs. Interrupter know that you love to chat, but you can't. You've got a deadline coming up your deadline. Another thing that gives me is clarity. My limited time frame gives me clear in a hurry. I'm always able to get clear on what exactly needs to get done before I leave the office. I'm also able to quickly decide what's not important. I write down specifically what it is that I must get done before I leave for vacation and what must get done today. That gives me a clear picture helping me lock out everything else. You can do the same thing by getting clear each morning and what you want to accomplish each day. Set your own deadlines and hold yourself accountable. Another thing I have overflowing the day before vacation is energy and my pumped up about my upcoming vacation. Heck yeah, you bet I am. That energy provides an emotional fuel that allows me to move at almost twice the rate I normally do. I move from task to task with speed and I enjoy the process. I'm thinking less about the task, especially those unpleasant things and more about the end result. And getting them done in this case is leaving for my vacation with a clear head and being able to fully leave work behind. But this type of energy is also created on a daily basis when you're being really productive, when you're knocking things out one after another and really getting results, when you eliminate distractions and you are really moving the ball forward, it creates more and more energy. *With that momentum delegation is something that I'm still working to improve, but it comes much easier. On the day before my vacation, I can ask myself, am I able to get this done today? If the answer isn't a solid yes, boom, I delegated to someone else*, if I take on this task would allow me to complete all my other tasks today. If not, boom, hand it off to somebody else. Now, usually everyone knows I'm going on vacation, so delegation is expected. And that's one of the reasons why I think it comes a little bit easier for me in this instance because I've got a free pass to delegate, delegate, delegate. But there is no reason we can't have this mindset every single day. And seeing the power of delegation on that day before my vacation and seeing how much more I can get done when I'm able to hand things off and delegate helps to make delegations something I do more on a daily basis. Results boy, the day before vacation is all about results. I get clear on what needs to be done and focus like a maniac to ensure those items are completed either by me or someone else. There is no tomorrow. Well, there is, but I'm not going to be here. I'm going to be on the beach. So that urgency compels me to work while avoiding all distractions. Now, unfortunately, I don't go on vacations every week or even every month, but what I've learned in that day before vacation has helped me every other day. Now, don't get me wrong, I might not have the same gusto as the day before vacation, but I can use the same principles to increase my productivity dramatically. Let's apply this to everyday life. Step one, get clear on the results you want. If you ask yourself what needs to get done, there will always be more things than there is time. *Instead, ask yourself what outcome or result is most important today? What things that, if I get done today, would make today a great success.* This helps to provide focus and clarity, but most important is focused on results and production, not just being busy. *Look for items to delegate for me and most of my clients, delegation does not come easily. We may believe that nobody can do it as good as we can. We may be hesitant. To offload our tasks, we're not want to deal with training someone else on how to do it, but we only have one hundred and sixty eight hours in the week and we're limited in our focus. More importantly, if you're in a position of leadership or you're a high performer, they're tasks that are more critical than others towards the success of your results and that of the organization. Now, maybe someone won't do it exactly as you would, but as that's so bad if it frees you up to focus on those items that are most critical to your success*. Next, stiff arm distractions. Don't let Bob waste 20 minutes of your time telling you about what he had for lunch. Be polite, but be candid, Bob. Let's catch up later. I'm in the middle of some things right now and got to go. Lastly, challenge yourself to clear your daily board when you decide the night before or that morning what needs to be accomplished that day. Stick to it, make it a challenge to get it done no matter what, just like you would before you leave for vacation. That will help you use Parkinson's law and create the energy to make it happen. So here's to you, treating every day like the day before vacation.

*Habits & Routines - The Key to Any Change*

First off, congratulations on making it this far, if you stuck with me till now, you are no doubt well on your way to becoming more productive. That is, if we can turn your ideas into reality. Now, the easiest way to do that is with habits and routines. *We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit*. Yeah, yeah, I know it's cliche and I'm sure you've heard it before, but it's true. The vast majority of our actions, decisions and behaviors on a daily basis are habits, things we do every day without consciously thinking about it. Now what is a habit? A habit is simply a neural firing pattern in the brain. Every thought you think or action you take is a pathway in your brain and it gets stronger every time that you do it. The more you do something, the faster the connection. I've heard one. Neuroscientists use the analogy between dialup and high, high speed Internet. When you first learn something or do something, it's very conscious and deliberate and requires lots of brainpower and resources. The more you do it, the more automatic it becomes. And those connections in your brain speed up with many habits. They're kicked off before we even know it and sometimes without your conscious awareness. Like I said before, we've covered quite a bit of ground in this course, but none of it will work if you don't use it and create new routines and new habits. The absolute best way to change or start any new behavior is to turn it into or create a new habit. This uses the power of automaticity and will allow you to operate on autopilot. You won't need to feel like it, be motivated or have to remember it will just become a new part of you. Think about this morning or last evening. Did you have to motivate yourself to brush your teeth? My guess is not. I'm sure it's a habit that you do without much conscious thought, but it wasn't always that way. I've got a three year old and a six year old, and I can tell you that that habit needs to be created like anything else. So how do we do it? Let's keep this simple. I could probably do an entire course just on habits. In fact, maybe one day I will. But again, complexity can be the enemy of execution. So let's keep it simple.

There are three parts to any habit. First, there's a trigger. Now this is what starts the behavior. It could be an event, a person, a place or even a time of day. For example, when I get home, I change my clothes and turn the TV on. Or maybe when I when the alarm goes off, I get up and put on my gym clothes and go for a run. The routine is the act itself is the thoughts you think or the behaviors or actions you take after that trigger. And the third part of a habit is the reward. With any habit, there's some type of reward, even if that reward is something as simple as comfort. So here's how we take the new things we've learned in our new ideas and turn them into habits,

*no one* decide on the outcome or result that you want and create one behavior that you can start today, then pick a trigger selected trigger for that new behavior. In fact, there's some research done regarding implementation intention that suggests that you can increase your success rate by 300 percent. *If you pick a trigger and pick a specific time, you're going to do that new behavior*. For example, after I brush my teeth, I will read my morning goals. After I sit down at the office, I will create my plan for the day after I closed down my computer. I will create my action list for tomorrow and last while you're building that habit, once you complete that behavior, celebrate with a reward. So once you have decided on your behavior, select your trigger, attach it to something that you already do every day that will kick off your behavior and then celebrate the process. Now, a couple of quick best practices.

No one starts so small that you can't say no. You must understand the habit is more important than the behavior early on. It can take upwards of sixty six or more days to create a habit. And oftentimes we try to start too big and we're too grandiose in our ideas. And the habit never has a chance to take place. So, for example, if your goal is to do ten push ups before you get in the shower, start with one push up, do one push up in the first week and do to push ups the second week, the habit is much more important than the behavior. Once you've ingrained the habit, the behavior will become automatic and then you can move it up from there. Many people wait to be inspired, but it's the daily routines that trigger your inner genius, you get inspired by actually getting into action. Remember, Stephen King said, I write when I'm motivated, but it just so happens I'm motivated every day at eight a.m.. Now, I'll leave you with this parting thought. We've all heard that Rome wasn't built in a day, but they were laying bricks every hour. You don't have to build everything today. Just lay your first brick. Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you want to become tomorrow. Right now I want you to decide which behavior you want to turn into a habit, pick your trigger and start it today. Start so small that it feels easy and that you can't say no and increase it over time as that habit becomes more and more automatic.
