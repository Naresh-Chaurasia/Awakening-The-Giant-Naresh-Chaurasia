=== Section 1: Introduction

*About your instructor*

Well, hello there and welcome to the goal setting mastery course. My name is Himesh and I am truly honored to be your instructor for this course. First things first, I would just like to congratulate you for taking this course. I feel that very, very few people in the world actually take their goals seriously. They let life go by before it's actually too late and without actually pursuing what what they what their goals are, what goals are. So I'd just like to congratulate you on that. Now, before we get started, I just thought that I would introduce myself as your instructor. I think it's important that we know each other. So, you know, the voice behind a lot of the slides that will be coming through on this course. So I just thought I would start off this this course with a little bit about myself. So as you are aware, my name is Himesh Tragedy, and I was actually born in Zimbabwe. And for those of you don't know where Zimbabwe is, it's in the southern part of Africa. It's the small t part shaped country just above South Africa. And that's where I was. That's where I was born. It was such a beautiful country. I did my primary and my secondary education in my high school. And then I, I was I then moved to South Africa to pursue my bachelor's degree. So I'm a bachelor of I have a bachelor of pharmacy degree. So I am a pharmacist by profession. I still practice pharmacy on the side. But teaching is my passion. Inspiring people is my passion. And that's why I decided to actually create this course. The goal setting mastery course. Now, let's I just thought I would give you a bit of a brief background on how, you know, I was as a person when I was in high school, sorry, in university. So during the first and second year of university, I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression. I had this, I would say disorder. I'm not sure whatever you want to call it, it was put it this way. My my I wasn't in the right mental state. And there were a number of factors to it. When I was young, my father went through a health, a very scary health episode multiple times, and he was diagnosed with a brain tumor. And then he had a lot of brain surgery. And this really sort of affected me. And I was I was diagnosed with this and I was given medication and I wasn't really at the peak of where I should be from mental state. And and I you know, judging from where I come from, it was nobody would have thought that I was really fully equipped to deal with the realities of life and put it that way. Now, after I graduated, I thought that, you know, I was I was, you know, armed with this beautiful degree, this powerful degree. And I had education behind me. And I'm going to go on and I'm going to conquer the world and all my goals are going to be fulfilled. That's what most of us think when you come out into the the so-called real world. Unfortunately for me, that that really wasn't the case. Life had its own set of plans. And when I went back to my home country of Zimbabwe, we were plagued with a massive, massive economic crisis that hit Zimbabwe. Now, this wasn't like a recession of any sort that we've seen in recent times. It was what we characterized as hyper inflation. And in fact, because of the hyper inflation situation, both myself and my family, we essentially went broke. So whatever we had all our life savings, everything, we we literally lost it over a span of about a year and we were literally broke. The the only thing that sort of kept us afloat was, I mean, we had a roof over our heads and I sort of had a job that was giving in some income, but we were just, you know, keeping our head above water. And I just thought I'd show you. So this was if you if you look at the slide here, it was the worst hyperinflation situations of all time where you can see that those are actually that's actually legal currency for Zimbabwe. And the highest denomination note was at that time was one hundred billion dollars. But it did get worse than that. I'll show you on the next slide. It was absolutely. Mind boggling where, you know, you had a certain amount of money in the bank account and overnight that money used to just inflate and the inflation figures were were in the triple, if not four digit categories was something that was really unheard of. So for free, if you sort of read up on the Great Depression that happened in the 1920s, it was exactly like that, except I would feel that it was far more worse than that. The sorry I beg your pardon, the highest denomination note was actually a 100 trillion dollar note. So one hundred trillion dollars was the highest denomination. And that would pretty much purchase you probably a loaf of bread. And that's how it was. So the stories that you see, the stories that you read about or hear about Zimbabwe and the hyperinflationary situation are all actually true. We used to go with wheelbarrows full of money to the supermarket and my salary was was paid essentially like this. And your salary is worth so much during today. But then when you decide to go to the supermarket, say tomorrow, the price of the item is actually inflated. And so how do you sort of run your life? And the reason that the point that I'm actually trying to to illustrate here is that I went through a fair amount of adversity when I was young. I was diagnosed with anxiety, depression, and then all of a sudden this massive economic crisis hits Zimbabwe, but the story goes on. So because of all of the situation, I was actually forced to move to another country because they I had to make ends meet. I had to support my family. So I actually had to move to another country to support my family there. I had to actually procure groceries, basic groceries and actually drive across the border. So I worked in a country known as Botswana. I used to work there, drive across the border with some groceries so that we can replenish the groceries at home because they were simply not available in Zimbabwe and things were very, very tough. Now, the interesting part was while I was working in Botswana, the the economy then reverted to a United States based dollar system. So we we used the US dollar as our official currency and things immediately sort of stabilized. And if I could say literally within 24 to 48 hours, they stabilized. But the funny thing, we had all this money that we had earned and we're trying to sort of save it up. And overnight there, you know, the the banking system came and came across a a conversion factor where they said, right. You know, we need to because we're dollar rising. We're going to convert whatever money you have into a US dollar based currency. And the conversion rate is there was actually no calculation, in my opinion. There was no calculation on how they did it. So Somsak they converted all the currency that we had in the bank account into a US dollar currency. And again, literally overnight, all the trillions of dollars that we had in the account literally reverted to maybe a couple of hundred dollars. And that was over a span of like one or two years that literally, you know, we're saving up. And all of a sudden now we're back to square one where we have nothing. So we went broke once and we went broke again. But things were looking up. We went broke again, but things were sort of looking up. And I managed to get a full time job and things were trickling along well. We managed to sort of make ends meet because things were sort of improving. But then I sensed that things were not things were actually going to go back to where they were. And so essentially I decided together with my wife that I had to emigrate to New Zealand. So I'm now based in New Zealand. In case you're wondering where all the life savings that I had accumulated over those number of years, I actually spent, you know, with the cost of the flights and I came here as a student. And so essentially everything that I had, I made a conscious decision and I said, right, that's it. I need to create a new life for myself. And I and I migrated to New Zealand, so. I used all my life savings for that, and I remember arriving in New Zealand, I had two bags and I think I had a couple of thousand. I think it was about five thousand dollars with me enough to buy me a car and just get me for the first sort of month. Now, the reason why I thought I would tell you that is just to give you guys a bit of a gist of where I'm going with this course. *And it's so so judging from my past, you know, you would think I was not really equipped to deal with all the complexities that that life was throwing at me, all these sort of curveballs*. And I just thought to myself, if there has to be a better way. And I started going about setting goals for myself and, you know, they started off as small goals. And then I started to to accomplish a few of them here. And then I thought to myself, I said, you know, this is this is wonderful. And so the reason why I've created this course is that I want to show you a pathway on not only setting your goals, but also achieving them, which is what this is all about. So what I'll do is I'll continue with my story, I'll continue with my story and its goals. So most of this will make sense once you go through the course. *But in a nutshell, what I what I actually did was I prioritise three areas of my life. One was my family. One was my job. And most importantly, was my part time business. And I think the part time business is the most sort of important thing, because it was the only way that I could get out of the financial rut that I was in*. Now, I just want to take a pause here. The exact strategy that I used to start working on my goals to try to start achieving anything was the exact blueprint, the map technique that I'm actually going to take you through this course. So I followed the step by step and I was able to accomplish many of my goals. So what then happened was I dedicated two hours a day to the part time business using what we call a compartmentalization technique. And I'm going to take you through the compartmentalisation technique later on in the course. And that was the technique that actually helped me gain momentum. Now, due to this, I created three part time businesses, maybe the goal of my dreams, and I was able to replenish my my parents retirement fund. Now, that was that's just sort of a small aspect to to my to my overall goals at that particular. I'm sharing this because at that particular moment in time, my financial situation was was in need of a desperate I was in need of desperate help. And so that's why I focused on this. Later on, I, I did my mission in life. And I'm going to teach you about mission statements. And my mission was to actually inspire and teach as many people around the world to in order to have for them to have better lives. And which is why this course has come up. So in a nutshell, that that is my story. And I just want to let you know that this this technique that I'm about to teach you works if you put in the work. And I think that's that's the most important thing. And one thing I also want to mention is that I did all of this while having a full time job. So if you are one of those people who have a full time job and you're finding out how am I going to do this, I did it while having a full time job. And I'm going to teach you exactly how you do all of this, even though you you you may be very, very busy. I thought I have a quick section on why I feel I'm qualified to teach you as as your as your instructor. So so throughout these years, I've actually immersed myself in personal development and have developed strategies that have enabled me to get through adversity. I'll be using all of that knowledge that I have gained. I'll be teaching you the specific techniques to know and to gain what you want in life and also techniques on how to get what you want using what we call an advanced gold setting formula, which is the technique that I'm actually going to teach you about and putting in the action. I've put in the action myself and I've seen results. So I feel that I'm able to teach that. And by teaching that, I hope to develop a specific action plan to reach your goals using a step by step time management technique that I'm also going to teach you. So I really look forward over the next hour, hour and a half to take you to. All of this.

*What This Course Will Offer You* - #Good Read!#

What this course will offer you. Enabling you to know exactly what you want in life by helping you find your way, another way to phrase this is to find your true purpose in life. A lot of people don't know what the purpose is. You may be one of them. People get so inundated with their daily routine of life, they simply wake up, go to work or their business, come home. And the next day is the exact same as the previous day.

*This course aims to help you find your true purpose and break the mundane routine of life. This course, we'll take you through a careful goal setting and planning process in this course, there is a comprehensive chapter that outlines a detailed goal setting process. We will talk about smart goals and we'll do an extensive brainstorming session with the use of the workbook. Converting each goal into a set of actionable steps, using something known as a compartmentalisation technique*. These are part of a chapter that outlines this technique. The idea behind this is that each aspect of your life will be divided into different compartments. This will enable you to plan your life accordingly and also eliminate the feeling you get when you get overwhelmed with so many things to do. Organizing each day to fit those actionable steps, something known as the compounding effect, we will come across the principle known as the compounding effect, which is in essence a principle that states that in order to achieve your goals, small, incremental actions towards your goals are necessary. The course will take you through formulating your own action plan towards your goals. And most importantly, highlighting the mindset that is actually required to live the life of your dreams, itemised current mental programming mindset will play a very important part in achieving your goals. This is the most important aspect that you will need to master, which is why I have dedicated a big chapter on helping you get the right mindset. The single most important factor that distinguishes successful individuals who have achieved their goals is their mindset, which is why I will include aspects such as your current mental programming. In other words, what is your current mindset and where do you need to get to in order to be successful?

*Bridging The Gap* - #Good Read!#

Bridging the gap. The cat that I'm referring to here is the gap between where you are and where you want to be and the necessary steps that will help you cover this gap. After considerable research and using my own experience, there are four key components that are required to achieve your goals. These are as follows, so firstly, knowing where you are and where you want to be, this is a pretty obvious statement and you might be thinking, I know where I am in life, but you'll be surprised that the vast majority of people don't know where they are in life. They don't know how far away they are from achieving their goals, if they have any in the first place. They also don't know what their purpose is. You may be one of them. The second aspect is how you plan to bridge that gap and achieve your goals, planning is a fundamental process that one has to do in order to achieve the goals. The third aspect is how you train your mind to achieve your goals. I have mentioned before that mindset required for achieving success is one of the most crucial factors. And the fourth aspect is how you everything action is usually what separates a person from achieving anything in life, massive, determined and consistent action is the name of the game. There is a saying that I have always lived by, and it was taught to me by one of my mentors. And and the same goes as follows. *Thoughts will determine what you want, but action ultimately determines what you get*. We will delve deeper into these four aspects in the chapters to follow.

*Introduction To The MAAP Technique*

image::goal-setting/maap.png[]

So in this chapter, I just want to give you an introduction to the map technique, early on, I spoke about the four key elements that are required for you to go from where you are to where you want to be. I have abbreviated these into something called map. I feel this is a perfect acronym or abbreviation because in its core essence, this is essentially a map to achieve your desired life. So let's go through what map stands for.

The M stands for *mindset*, as mentioned before, mindset is a key component that I have highlighted already.

The A stands for *awareness* awareness is knowing exactly what you want out of life, and again, I have spoken about this in detail previously.

The A stands for *action*, so these are the small, incremental actions that you need to do on a daily basis, actions that are in line with your goals.

And finally, the P, which stands for *Planning*, and again, as highlighted previously, what planning is required to achieve your goals?

=== Section 2: Awareness - Knowing What Your Goals Are

*Introduction To Awareness*

I would now like to move on to the awareness part so early on when I spoke about the map technique, the first ace stands for awareness. *So awareness, as mentioned before, is knowing exactly what you want out of life. And not only that, knowing where you stand currently is also part of that awareness*.

*Awareness is something that comes from deep within. It's your inner desires of what you want out of life*. Some of you listening already know what your inner desires are for your life. However, some don't. For those of you who don't. The question that probably comes to your mind is how will I know?

So let's turn to the workbook that I've attached in the section. If you already know what you what you want out of life, it'll still be worthwhile to do this exercise. So from the worksheet, you need to answer the following questions. Or question, what do you want out of life and by this, *I don't mean anything materialistic, like a new car, a new house or any other materialistic things, I mean something that's deeper. And I need you to think long and hard about it. I want you to write. The first few things that actually popped into your mind, and that's where you write it in this section. So just take time out, pause this video and just do a little bit of brainstorming and what you actually want out of life*.

Welcome back. So from hereon, we will implement something called the Why questioning technique. Now, this technique is very simple and self-explanatory. After you write your first statement, you need to ask yourself, why this? Why do you want what you said you want? Then you need to think again long and hard and write your answers in the next paragraph. So you written your initial statement. Ask yourself this. Why this? And instead of with because. And so on and so forth. After writing the next statement, again, repeat the process, as I said, and keep repeating the process until you find out what you exactly want out of your life, how will you know that this is what you want? It's by following your gut instinct, you will get an inner satisfaction. Or a sort of like a tube line type of moment or an aha moment. Now, keep that statement in mind, the last statement that you've actually written here. Keep that in mind. And we will go on into the next section to define your personal mission statement.

*Defining Your Mission Statement*

You would have probably come across the phrase mission statement before when you worked at an organization. So most organizations have this mission statement, which is basically a statement that best describes an organization's key purpose and value and what is committed to doing. *Similarly, you yourself should have a mission statement that clearly describes what you feel like. Your purpose in life is it clearly separates what's important and what's not in your life. And it also describes your values*. So your mission statement is an expansion of the last statement that you wrote in the previous section in the workbook. Which is that statement over there. So for for this purpose, I just want to give you a few examples of how you can do this. So let's say hypothetically that you're in a desire is to become a musician. You want to become one because you. Obviously love music, so why do you want to become a musician, because you love music. Why do you love music? You love music because it brings joy to you. If you notice, I keep asking myself that question that the why statement. So because it brings joy to you. Why does it bring joy to you? It brings joy to everyone else listening to your music, that is why it brings joy to you. So your mission statement could go something like this, My mission in life is to create music, music that taps into a person's soul and brings them everlasting joy. Notice that nothing in this analysis is materialistic. So in other words, in this particular example, the person didn't state they want to become a musician because they wanted to become rich and famous. So in other words, making money or gaining anything materialistic is a product of your efforts but shouldn't be part of your overall mission, you will find that by pursuing your mission, the money will come in automatically. So I want you to refer back to the notebook, the workbook. And just do a little bit of analysis of your statements here in this last statement that you've written is most likely the most inner desire that you have what you want out of life. And then come up with your own personal mission statement. I'll give you my mission statement, for instance, so my personal overall mission statement is as follows to teach and inspire as many people in the world as possible through the lessons that I've learned in life so that I can go on to become better human beings and fulfill their desires to the fullest. And this is what I'm currently doing right now. This course of a year, I'm hoping to actually teach and inspire as many people as I can to lead better lives. That is my personal overall mission statement. It's time to make yours what's your mission statement? You can stop this recording before we go into the next section and do an in-depth analysis and come up with your own mission statement.

*Introduction To Goals*

I just want to take you through exactly what a goal is, so a goal is a stepping stone towards your overall purpose in life, another way of defining goals, ambitions. Yes. The other small little steps that will lead you to the bigger picture. Now, you may have come across a term known as smart goals, so what exactly are smart goals before we go into the actual goal setting process? Let's go through this in detail.

*So the s stands for specific*, the lesson here is that the goals that you set should not be too broad. An example of a broad term goal is a goal such as I would like more money in my life or I would like a promotion at work. These goals are too broad and should be more specific. So, for example, being more specific, being more specific with the I want more money goal, this could be converted to. I would like to earn ten thousand dollars more this year than last year, or if you're looking at the promotion at work, then a goal such as I would like to be promoted to the position of general manager or head of communications, etc. Those are more specific goals. *To help you draft more specific goals, asking questions such as what, who, where, how and which will aid you*.

*The M stands for measurable, your goals should have some form of monitoring or tracking*. So in other words, you should be able to know how far you are away from achieving your goals, whether you're on track and ultimately finding out when you have finally achieved your goals.

*The A stands for achievable*. So, in other words, how realistic are your goals? Are you able to accomplish it based on your current constraints, such as financial factors or time constraints or resource constraints? Also, is this the right time for you? So, for example, I will go back to the example of wanting a promotion at work. You may you may need to step back and ask yourself questions such as do you have the right qualifications or experience to suit that role? If you don't, then maybe setting another goal, such as developing the experience and qualifications necessary to get that promotion before you actually set the goal of getting a promotion.

Also to highlight the example of, for example, wanting more money, you may need to step back and ask yourself, how will you get more money? You won't get more money by doing the same thing that you're doing now. So you may need to re-evaluate your goal and change it to having a goal of developing, for example, a second stream of income. That would be a goal prior to having more money.

*The R stands for relevant*, this means that the goal that you have sent have said should be worthwhile and full of meaning to you. Also, is this the right time for you? So, for example, if you would like a promotion at work and your overall goal is to be financially free, then is it worth gaining that extra qualification that you need for gaining that experience? Or should you utilize your time in developing another stream of income? Those are the types of questions that you need to ask yourself.

*The T stands for time based*, you need to set a date or some sort of timeline to achieve your goal. It is absolutely critical to assign this date, this deadline date, as mentally you are now under a deadline to achieve that goal. So the main question that you need to ask yourself is by when should I accomplish this goal? So now that you've had an introduction to what goals are in the next section, we will move on to the actual goal setting process.

*Goal Setting - Part A*

This part of the chapter will cover goal setting, so this is part one of goal setting. This particular part will require the use of the workbook that is included in the previous link, please download that workbook if you haven't already. *So the first part of goal setting is what we call a brain dump, a brain dump is essentially dumping, for lack of a better word, all your thoughts onto a piece of paper*. In this case, I have provided you with the workbook in the workbook, I have divided goals into four different categories which are as follows. So this adventure, financial, family and health. This here is the workbook. And we'll just scroll through.

So these are the four categories of goals. So let's briefly describe the category of call. Now, the *adventure goals*, these will include aspects such as your travel goals, for example, it could be visiting the Seven Wonders of the World.

*Then you move on to family goals*. I just scroll down, so Femi goes, these include aspects such as your *relationships*, what goals do you have with your partner or with your family?

Then there's *financial goals*, so this is self-explanatory, basically goals that deal with money, so an example could be goals for your financial well-being. It could be opening a business for for having a second stream of income. That's such as that.

And then there's also *health goals*, again, self-explanatory if you're wanting to lose weight, for example, or just be fit, these are the types of goals that should be included in this section here.

Now, in the workbook, you'll notice that I've also included another category called *Other Goals*, I have left the section for you to also complete if you feel that the goals that you have don't fit any of the above criteria. So they don't slide into adventure goals or family goals of financial or health. Then please feel free to fit them into this category.

Now, the the type of goals, the classification of goals that I have used here are mere guideline for you to use if you feel that. For example, these categories you would want to change, then please feel free to do so at the start of this course under the chapter of a way, as I explain the process of finding your way or your purpose in life. It's important now to include certain important goals that will also lead to your overall purpose in life. This is not to say that your other goals don't matter. They do, but it's best to prioritize goals that will be used as stepping stones to achieve what your mission is. So now it's time to pause this video and it's time for action. I want you to start listing all your goals that come to your mind, it will be a good idea to first list everything that pops into your head onto a separate piece of paper, and then later on, you can transcribe those goals into the different categories that I spoke about, namely the adventure goals or the financial goals, et cetera. So please pause this video now and let's do that Brain-Dump.

Welcome back. I certainly hope that you have done the brain dumping exercise, if you haven't, then I strongly suggest that you do it now or else the rest of the chapters become meaningless. So assuming you have done the brain dump and have categorized the goals into the different categories, the next stage is to determine which goals are short term, medium term or long term. *It's time to be realistic at this stage, not all goals can be short term*. We live in an in an environment where everything is available at the touch of a button and as a result, we expect things fast. This is not the case with life in general and we have to be patient. Everything that we want in life cannot be achieved until within six months or a year. So it's time for reflection. At the stage, you will need to analyze each goal that you wrote down. And the important part here is to prioritize which goals need to be worked on immediately and which goals can be worked on at a later stage. So going back to the workbook, each goal that you have listed down, you will need to go   and classify the goal into either a short term goal or a medium term goal goal or a long term goal. A simple tick in any of these boxes will suffice. So short term goals are the zero to six month goals. Those are the immediate type of goals. And if you want to concentrate on those, any of the goals that that you want to achieve quicker, then classify them under the short term goal. The medium term goals are roughly goals that you want to achieve within six to 18 months. And then the long term goals are goals that are still important. But they can wait and then goals that you want to achieve probably after the next 18 to 24 months. So please proceed with this and we will take the goal setting process further in next section.

*Goal Setting - Part B*

Welcome back. I certainly hope that the previous chapter and the previous exercise has been eye opening and certainly brought a lot of things into perspective for you. So in this section, we will proceed to make your gold smarter. So I spoke about smart goals earlier on and I will help you make your smarter in the section. The first step in this is to choose at least five to seven short term goals that you feel are priority for each category. Now, the amount of goals that you choose is entirely up to you. You can choose less or more. The important thing here is that it should be comfortable for you and not too overwhelming and at the same time, not too less. You can fill these goals into the worksheet, provided I will take you through the smart process now. So I'll just flick through. To the worksheet. So let's have the worksheet I've just said, choose top three short term goals, it could be five to seven. It could be really any number that you feel is right for you. So let's say, for example, one of your. Adventure Goals was to visit Rome, for example, and that was actually a short term goal of yours. Or it could be an eagle. Now, just scrolling down, we want to make each call smarter. OK, and what do I mean by that? So once you've written down the goal here. We need to be now specific, so you need to ask the following questions. What do you want to accomplish or why do you want to accomplish this goal, who will be involved, ways it located and which resources are needed? These are just some of the questions that you need to ask yourself in order to be a little bit more specific about that goal and not making it too broad. The second one is measurable, so the question that you can ask yourself is how will you measure the progress and how will you know if you've attained your goal? Second is the third one is achievable. The question that you should ask yourself here is how can you achieve your goal? Is it realistic enough based on what resources you have? If not, what resources will you need? And let's say, for instance, that you find that you may need a lot of resources for it, then making those resources or achieving those resources as a goal could be the solution to this. They are relevant now. The question here is, how relevant is your goal to your overall mission statement? Is it worthwhile? And is this what you really want in life? And time bound now, this is also an important part, so state an exact time period that you will intend to fulfill this goal, state the exact amount of months because we're working with short term goals, it should be within months. So this is just. A guideline I mean, these questions are just a guideline to kind of zone into each goal and make it more smarter, the more smarter your goals, the more specific, the more measurable, the more achievable, the more relevant. And the more time bound they are, the higher your chance of actually achieving your goals. So on the workbook, you could see that I've just chosen goal one, goal two for your adventure goals, goal three. And then I've moved on to family goals and we've repeated the process. *So the key is just choose a few if it's three or five or seven, whatever you feel comfortable with. And the important thing here is that it should be the short term goals that you work on. Now, once you've achieved, for example, some of your short term goals or all of your short term goals, then your medium term goals immediately become now your short term goals and the long term goals that you had previously become, the medium term goals*. So they kind of keep shifting. So it's always important to actually have this template with you and then all you need to do is just strike out the goal that you've achieved. And then the medium term goals now become the short term goals. You have the advantage of having the workbook so you can actually print these out multiple times and keep doing the goal setting process as described further. In the next section, I'm going to take you through having an action plan for you, for your goals. So see you on the other side.

=== Section 3

==== The Myth Of Having No Time

So in the section, I just want to move now on to taking action and again, a very important chapter, as I mentioned before, *thoughts will determine what you what you want, but ultimately action determines what you get*. So this is, again, a very important chapter and it requires for you to take massive and consistent action. Now, before we get into the gist of of developing an action plan. I want to just cover something. I want to actually debunk the myth of having no time I thought would be a good idea to do this small exercise for you, as many of you probably have an objection. And that objection is that you don't have enough time in your life to actually fit your goals. And that is one of the when I do a bit of coaching with some of my clients, they say that, look, I don't have a lot of time. Now, once you have completed this exercise from the workbook, hopefully you'll get an idea of how much time you actually have. So just turn to turn to the the workbook that's entitled Taking Action Under Debunking the Myth of Having No Time. And I'll just show you that's the worksheet that I'm talking about over there. So there's a little exercise for you to do here, so to help you along, I have created a small example for you, which we will go through now. OK, so. How many hours in a week? That's one hundred and sixty eight hours, so it's 24 times seven, 24 hour days time seven, OK, on average you probably spend about 40 hours a week at work. Now, some of you. It may be more. It may be less. And then hours of sleeping. Now, what I've done here is I've just estimated that you you probably sleep maybe seven to eight hours a day, and that's for seven days. So it's about 56 hours. So how many hours do you then have left in the week, that is 72 hours. How I arrived at that is 168, minus 40, minus 56. So it's about 72 hours left. Now, let's take into account your travelling time, so let's say you take about an hour or so or two hours a day getting to work. Let's say you spent about seven hours of of seven hours on the road in travel. And then there's these adhoc hours that you spent, so let's say it's about two hours a day for seven days, that's about 14 hours. So those hours could be anything from daily chores to, you know, picking up your kids from school or whatever the case would be. OK, now, the remaining hours that you then have as 51 hours that are left in a week. So 51 hours. During the week. Now, when you. Multiply that, that'll be about two thousand six hundred and fifty two hours in a year. So how did I arrive at that? It's like it's 51 hours during the week, this 52 weeks on average in a year. So that's two thousand six hundred fifty two hours in a year, which is approximately 110 days in a year. And these are 24 hour days. Now, do you still think that you have no time after this? Just think about it. If we go back to the worksheet, if you fill out all these. Those faces and calculate the number of hours that you are actually spending, doing each task, you will arrive at a pretty much significant figure. And I hope that you get the realization that time can be can be wasted very easily. And it's important to manage this important resource that you do have. So what I would like you to do is go ahead and complete this worksheet, just the first part. Of taking action and see for yourself how much time do you actually have left during the week and then even during the year? Because if you multiply that that figure and you exponentially grow it within a year, you come to the realization that you do have time. So in many, like when I'm coaching people, one of the main objections that I get from people is I don't have time. *And when I do this exercise, it brings into perspective that, yes, they do have time. It's just how that time is managed and how you how you spend that time*. That's the important thing. So go on. And fill this, just to get an idea of how much time you may have to work on your goals.
