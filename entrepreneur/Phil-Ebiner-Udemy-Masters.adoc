== Udemy Masters: Learn Online Course Creation - Unofficial - Phil Ebiner

=== Section 1: Course Introduction

*Welcome & How It All Works*

You just took an amazing first step into creating your next best oline course and having the most success with it. Whether you're completely new to creating online courses or you're a veteran or you're somewhere in between, this class will help you create better courses and make more money from them. So in this video I want to welcome you and thank you for enrolling and talk a little bit more about the structure of this course, how online courses actually work and then my personal secret to success. This course is all about what I've done, specifically every exact step that I've done to have success and I hope that it can help you replicate my success And I'm going to be getting more into the numbers in the next lesson, *But I've sold over a million dollars in sales with my own online courses. With my online courses I've paid off over a hundred thousand dollars in student loan debt. that's a lot of debt, I've paid for my own wedding, traveled the world and even purchased my own home with my beautiful wife Isabel*.

So this course is structured in the way that you are going to actually create a course. So it starts out with coming up with the best course idea, validating your course beforehand so that you know when you launch it it's going to be successful. Then we're going to launch into the course creation process, you'll learn different types of course videos that you can create, different types of lessons, how to create an amazing course outline that keep students engaged, what equipment I recommend and what you can use even on a budget to create amazing high quality courses that look professional and really do teach students in the best way. And then I'm going to show you exactly how to create lessons, design slides design different types of lessons, use editing to create more engaging classes, and then how to export it at the highest quality possible.

After that, we learn how to publish your course, this is about where you can publish. So we'll talk about course marketplaces like Udemy, skillshare and a number of others that I had success on plus self-hosting your courses. After learning how to publish and launch your course, giving a specific step by step strategy of launching your own course. We'll talk about more promotional strategies and really growing your own business And brand how do you take it to the next level with this course, and with the next courses that you create using things like YouTube, Podcasting, Webinars and at your own website walking through the best practices for creating website that actually converts to purchasing students, will cover all of that in the latest lessons in this course. So then the key to success is making sure that you get high quality reviews of your course, if you can do that and if you have people actually watching your course, then you're going to have success. *Most of my personal sales from marketplaces ones that I'm not selling on my own come from search engine optimized courses meaning that my courses rank high in the search engines on places like Udemy or skillshare*. And the way that I get my courses to rank high is with lots of great reviews and lots of people actually engaging in the courses. So how do I do that? Well first I make a high-quality course that will get high reviews when students who actually want that course enroll in the course. So first you need to match the students expectations, you don't want to make promises that you can't keep with your course, you want to have people enroll in your course and have their expectations matched and if that happens, they're going to give a good review for your course. The next thing is driving my own traffic to the course, getting some initial students in there, so that their lessons are being played, practical exercises are being done, students are asking questions and this engagement also helps increase the keyword ranking or the search engine ranking of our courses. That's how I've had a lot of success. Now you might be sitting there saying: Well, this is great Phil, you have been doing this for a long time and it's easy for you to get a ton of course students in your courses when you lost them. But I didn't start out that way and you don't need to have an audience when you start out. When I started, I had no website I have never taught a course before, I had never really taught anything before, I know following on social media, I didn't have a YouTube channel and started from scratch. *And really the secret to my success has been: content, content, content, content, creating a lot of great courses but also surrounding content that relates to my courses like blog articles, YouTube videos, being on Podcasts, doing Webinars doing all kinds of other content that drives people to my courses* and it took me a while to get to where I am today but with this course and with all the secrets that I have now and all the tactics that I have now, you can do it a lot faster. So that's how this course is going to work, that's a little bit about how I create courses actually works and that's how I'm having success. We're going to dive in a lot deeper in the next few lessons and sections to teach you exactly step-by-step how to do these things. Again, thank you so much for enrolling in the class. I'm so excited to have you here. and like I say with all of my classes: I know it's not going to be perfect when I launch it, So if there's anything that I can do to make this course better for you specifically, reach out to me, send me a message and give me some advice for making my own courses better, that's another way that I make sure, that I have good reviews is by responding to student feedback and actually taking action. So that's something that you can do in your own classes as well. I'm so excited to brain dump all my my secrets and all the things that I've learned over the past half decade of teaching online courses. So let's get straight to it in the next few lessons.

*3 Ways to Make a Course Students Love*

Here are three things that you can do right now to start making your courses better, making your students happier, and getting better reviews for your course.

*Number one* is to make sure you add supplemental resources to your course, this could be anything from a PDF download to additional video  s or the audio version of your course. even if you're just taking your entire course outline and creating a PDF out of it and giving it to the students at the start of the class, this kind of supplemental download, will make students happy, they just love downloading things whatever it is, of course you do want to make it beneficial, but whatever it is, students are going to perceive your courses having more value if you have more downloads in it. One example of doing this was in my Photoshop class where we have practical exercises and we included the Photoshop files and any of the photos or the graphics that they needed to complete that exercise. It's easier to get students to take action if you kind of spoon feed them, if you give them everything they need to take action. Now it was easy for the Photoshop course but you can do it really with any course topic as well. come up with assignments and give them resources to help them out.

The *second thing* you can do is to add talking head footage and cut away footage or b-roll as we sometimes call it. these are the shots that you cut a way to that. Provide examples or more demonstration of what you're talking about and it's often better than just a slide with some text. First talking head videos are going to make your courses more engaging. *Just the fact that I'm here looking at the camera looking at you directly in your eyes, build some sort of connection with you, it's not impossible to build that connection just with my voice over some slides but it's easier to do a talking head video* and it doesn't have to be hard we'll talk about in this course how to create great talking head videos with whatever kind of equipment and whatever budget you have. I'm going to aside from the talking at video adding screencast examples or actual video examples demonstrating what you're talking about just adds to the quality of your course and it helps teach better than just again, a slide based course.

And then *the third thing* you can do is to keep your students engaged after enrolling in the course is to send the messages, educational announcements or emails with bonus ideas, tips, content if you have a blog article or a podcast you listen to that you thought was interesting that your students might like and why it might help them out, send it to them they might find it valuable as well. You could also do things like holding competitions or challenges within your class telling your students to take action and to complete with the other students in your class, if you can give away some sort of prize, it won't really encourage people to take part in your competition. In my photography class, we gave away an Amazon Gift Card and we had hundreds of students submitting their best photos of the year for our annual competition. this kind of activity can also build a community within your student base and that will also help your students find value and enjoy your class better, all going back to getting more reviews which helps your course ranking and helps convert students potential students into buyers of your course. So these are three things that I want to just lead off with in this course. Three things that you can start right now doing with your own courses and three things to keep in mind if you're creating your first course for the entire process from outlining to production to launching and after you launch your course. Thanks a lot and we'll see you in another.

*Tips to Improve Your Course Taking Experience*

A really quick note before we continue to help improve your course, taking experience notes at the bottom of the video player, there's an option for speeding up or slowing down the playback, depending on if I'm talking too slow or too fast. You'll also see on the other side a button where you can change the quality of the video and also turn on captions. Now, these captions are automatically generated, so they're not 100 percent accurate, but hopefully they will help you if you want to see them. There's even an option to see a full transcript of the lecture again automatically generated. Lasley Udemy will soon prompt you for a review if they have not done so already. Your review truly helps other students know whether this is the right course for them as well as helps us know whether we're making a great course or not. If you're not ready to leave a review, you can click the ask me later button. But if you do leave a review, I truly appreciate it and thank you. All right. I hope you enjoy the rest of the course.

==== Proof of Success

NOTE: Later !!!

Welcome to this update video, Phil, from the future here, compared to when I recorded the original version of this class, a lot has changed since then and my personal life, a lot has changed with my business. The process and the way you have success with online courses has also changed a little bit. But most of what I was doing a few years ago and when I started out still remains true today. I've probably gained a few pounds. I've gained a beard this past week and I have two kids, twin boys and a girl on the way. At the time of recording this, I'm in a new office space from when I recorded the original content of this course and I've converted my garage into a studio. You can see a different background, which I don't use for all of my videos, but I'm going to get to that in a minute and talk about why I've set it up this way. But basically my day to day life looks very similar. I have continued to create more courses. I've created a lot of courses I've created expanding my brand and done a lot of cool things. But I also wanted to just say this is going to be a little bit longer of a video. And I like to put this earlier in the course so that one you can see my success and you can see a proof of my success. I'm going to share my income here, which I don't do anywhere else. And I'm also going to just walk through a lot of things that I've done and I'm planning for the future. This is my 2020 update. And so if you are brand new to teaching online courses, it might be beneficial for you to skip this video if you're just looking to learn the basics. And but it also might be beneficial to watch this and just see the updates, because there are things later in the course that have changed that I will go over in this video.

Awesome. So let's get into the proof of success. As you can see here on the screen now, I have my Udemy profile, which is still my main source of income with my online courses. I have over one million students now. Ninety nine courses that are currently published. Overall, I've probably had one hundred and twenty five or so, but I've unpublished. So I'm working on some. Many of these are translated versions of courses and people often ask how do you create so many courses. Some are translated versions as you can see here. And we'll talk a little bit more about that in just a minute. But also a lot of these are constructed classes. Awesome. So let's get straight into the income. So Udemy has been on fire over the past few years. And actually what has been a little bit different is that the past year it's been steady and I haven't put as much effort into growing my Udemy income as I have in the past. I have twin sons. They're 14 months right now at the time of this recording. And so I haven't been as I just haven't been putting as much time. I'm working about 16 hours a week on my business. The rest of the time I'm spending with my family. But you can see here the incredible numbers that I have still been able to maintain with my business. And that's because I've grown and I've put so much effort into it in the past. And I still continue to serve the audience, create more courses, update courses. But as you grow and establish yourself with top rated courses, you can see that it will continue to sell and even over the long term. So a typical month for me on Udemy is between 30 and 40000. I have my peaks, of course, in the big sales seasons, November, December and January, mostly November and January. Let's go to a previous year so you can see. So again, last year, twenty eighteen. This was the year that I actually put the most effort from 2017 to 2018 and I really saw my income ramp up. You can see it continues to grow here. And then through twenty, eighteen and twenty nineteen, it's kind of continued to grow. But just a little bit, not as much. November twenty eighteen huge month, eighty thousand top month for me. And so I'm actually recording this in November. So I'm looking forward to this year to see what happens this year. But incredible stuff. And I'm not the only one with this kind of income. There's people making a lot more than I do. And I don't show you this to brag. I just show you this to to show you that it's possible we can go back to my very first month. Sixty dollars. Sixty dollars in my first month, October 2012 jumped to 63 the next month to eighty eight the next month. And I was like, oh my God, this is a ton of money that I'm making. Let me continue to make courses. And then in April I hit my first one thousand dollars a month and my mind was blown. I was doing this on the side of my full time job, like many of you, I'm sure that are watching this course. And it was just incredible to see this extra income come in that I could use to pay down student loans to to start saving and investing. And it just continued to grow. And you can see from the graph that it continued to grow. But I just wanted to show you that I started out just like many of you who are putting out courses and you see these big names in the industry making lots of money and you're wondering how can you do it? Well, it typically does take time. So anyways, incredible stuff here on to me. I'm not sure if everyone interested in seeing kind of the progression, but just going through. You can see in 2014, two years after I started that Black Friday sale, past ten thousand dollars for the first time. So that's two years into it. It kind of hovered around that number for another year and then twenty fifteen a year later, double that amount to twenty four thousand the next year doubled that to forty five thousand. And then the next year, a little less than double, but seventy three thousand twenty seventeen, and then that's when I was putting in a ton of work. But since then, like I've said, because I have a family, I've taken the foot off the gas pedal and I've kind of slowed down and and I've made things, to be honest, better for my own life because I was working too hard on this, to be honest. And it was unsustainable to work like this with a family and having a good family balance. *But that is one of the beautiful things about having now this recurring income that is not me trading my hours for dollars, but it's coming in while I sleep, while I go on vacation, as long as I continue to serve my audience and and create better courses, improve my courses*. I'm I'm all in with you to me. And I go to Udemy live every year that I can. I've been through three of the four times so far. I missed last year because my twins were due that month. But this year in twenty nineteen I went to Udemy live and I'm, I'm more excited than ever about you to me for the future. All right, so this is you to me, but Udemy is just one source of income, and that's the beautiful thing with your your courses, there have been changes and I will say that. But in general, there's no exclusivity for putting your courses on other platforms. So I use platforms like Skillshare, the Stack Commerce Family, of course, platforms like Stack Skills, and they sell and promote them via social. And then I also have them on my own site. There is an update, though. I will say with you to me that on you to me, if you are in the Udemy for business program, then your courses moving forward have to be exclusive to you, to me for business. This is their subscription service that's available for business, other businesses to pay for their employees to get you to many courses. So that's kind of a tricky balance, depending on how much you're making with you. To me, for business, it might be better to leave your courses exclusive to you, to me for a business or to put them both on Skillshare, on your own site, on these other platforms as well. And that's a balance I'm learning right now. And trying to figure out Skillshare for me has always been consistent. A lot of people don't have as much success on Skillshare because they're not in the creative sort of arts, design, photography, those kinds of courses. I'm lucky that I am. And I've just been consistently putting my courses on there as well. Lifetime earnings, two hundred sixty six thousand. Nothing to blink about, but definitely a lot lower than than Udemy. And I've been on the platform for about the same amount of time. My courses just haven't been as good on Skillshare or their audience just isn't as big as you to me. But still an average of seven, eight, nine thousand dollars a month. Incredible, incredible stuff on Skillshare Stack. Commerce, as I mentioned, is a family of companies. It's a little bit trickier to get your courses on this platform. And don't worry, I go into all of this in the later sections of this course about the different platforms choosing your platforms, hosting. But ninety thousand dollars and this is probably over the past few years mostly. So again, another source of income from your courses. So I know it's a lot of work to put together a course up front, but remember, you're able to put this out on many different platforms. I look at them as little streams of income. One course can be put up and that little stream of income from each course comes and creates a giant Amazonian river of revenue, hopefully for for everyone. So then I also have my own platform. And as you can see, it's steadily increased. I have my Black Friday sales each year. I haven't done mine yet for this this year. But this is monthly revenue and a lot of this is coming recurring from my membership. So what I do on video is go online, which I host my courses using teachable. I packaged them all together for a monthly price. So this gives people the option. If they are interested in enrolling in a lot of my courses to get them all for one monthly price. Or you can pay annually or a lifetime membership. Up until this time, I've charged nine dollars a month, basically competing with your traditional other subscription services, whether it's Skillshare, Dotcom, Netflix, Amazon Prime, all these other subscription services. I am going to be increasing that a little bit this year because as I've added courses, it's become a more valuable membership to be in. This is honestly something that I don't promote too much, I continue to do most of my promotion to my courses hosted on Udemy. I just have my website and people end up on my membership because it is the main option on the homepage of my website, which you will see in just a minute. But every month or so, two or three thousand dollars, and it's continued to steadily grow over time. And this is just a great backup option. If anything happened to my other streams of income, and it's I would say it's good to have your courses on your own platform just to have there even if you're not promoting them. So if anything happened, you are ready to drum up the the promotions of your own platform so that you can can get that revenue and income back again. We're going to be covering a lot of this later in the course as well.

So if I had to pare down what I think it takes to be a successful online course creator so far in my journey and also moving forward, it's really stayed the same over time. The goal is to put together a good course that gets good reviews, because when your course gets a lot of good reviews, it ranks, well, pretty much pretty much on any platform you put it on. And so if your course is getting a lot of good reviews, then it's going to rank well on Udemy, which means it's going to get in front of more students who are searching for your topic, which means that you're going to get more sales, which means you're going to get even more reviews. Which means your ranking is going to increase or stay high and that cycle continues. The hardest part is when you're starting out or even when you're launching a new course. Even for me, when I'm launching a new course, especially if it's in a new topic area, it's hard to break through and compete with the well-established course creators and courses that are there that are ranking high. But that being said, that's pretty much the name of the game. So your mindset, if you're trying to succeed on Udemy or any of these platforms is how do I get some initial students in there? How do I get them to review the course? Highly, obviously, and doing in a natural way, meaning not telling them to do it, not doing it any legally or against the rules way, but just by creating a great course that they love. And then once you get more students, the benefit is that you can promote any existing or new courses to that audience and that helps when you create your next course or you promote your next course. And so that's why I've always created a lot of courses on you to me. And I've seen that most course creators have success by creating a lot of courses because you're able to cross promote within your audience and it just helps you to grow an audience that you can promote your new content to. And with more courses out there, it's more ways that people can find you and enroll in your courses and get into your email list. We'll call it again. We're going to cover all of this and future lessons. But basically on Udemy, you can send a promotional email to all of your students. Now, not all of them receive it because a lot of them can opt out and do opt out. But as you grow that audience and this could also be off platforms as well. That's why having a website, a YouTube channel, a social media presence, groups on social media doing all of this has helped me succeed because I've grown it over time. So when I launch a course now, it typically automatically makes a decent amount of sales. And when people enroll in courses, they generally will review it if they are going through it now, there's tricks and ways that you can try to get people to take more of your course. I mean, just making sure those first lectures of your course are engaging, making sure that those first lectures include actionable and things that people are actually learning. And it's not just a bunch of fluff about who you are as an instructor or your background, that kind of thing, making those first lessons engaging, which I've tried to do with this course, also including downloadable resources so that when someone enrolls in your course and then automatically in that first section, they get a nice PDF guide or some other downloadable cheat sheets or things like that, free ebooks, free audio version of your course, whatever it can be, practice files that make students excited and it makes it feel more valuable and more likely to leave a better review. Also sending it announcements, updates, updating your course and telling students about it, just encouraging students to keep going. That's going to lead to more reviews and not that many other instructors are paying that much attention to actually what happens after a student enrolls in the class. Everyone cares about getting people into the class, but once they do that, they kind of leave them and let them be and let them take the course. But the instructors who have success are the ones that pay attention and follow up and make sure the students are enjoying the classes. So that's basically how you can have success. Recently, since my last updated video over the past couple of years, if you ask me what are the things that have been most successful for me with my online course business, one is building a community off of Udemy via a Facebook group. So let's check that out. Here's my group on Facebook called Photography and Friends. Initially it was a group just four members of one course of mine, my best selling photography master class. But I realized that it could benefit a lot more than that, a lot more people than that. And so I open it up to students who are in my photography courses. And at the beginning of all of my courses, I tell people, hey, you can join this Facebook group as an added bonus, as a way to get more feedback, to post questions. And we do lots of stuff in this group. We have challenges we have at weekly adventures that we prompt people to go and take a certain type of photo. Every month I put up an editing tutorial with a file that people can download and practice on their own. We do competitions. We do monthly live streams where we answer questions. So this is all a benefit to students who enroll in my courses. And I think that's one of the ways we've had a lot of success and get good reviews for our photography courses is because once you enroll, you don't only get access to the course materials, but you get access to this amazing community that is super engaged and will help you out. So I'm just scrolling through here so you can see kind of what we've done. But over 30000 members have joined this. And all of these people are from our courses, which is pretty incredible. And this is over the past year or so, like a year and a half since we started this. So here you can see an example of a weekly adventure or a weekly challenge. This week, we asked people to post a photo of their daily transport. So people have been commenting and and this is so cool. I haven't even looked at these, actually. So we got people posting all kinds of shoes, big rigs. Tuck, tucks, tricycles, jeeps, all kinds of stuff that people are taking for their transportation. Let me look at our announcements, because this is where you can kind of see the other stuff that we've been posting just to give you a sense of how to keep create an engaging group. So these are going out weekly this this week. I posted a video because we're coming out with a new course on photo composition, asking students what do they need help with in terms of composition. This is was just posted. Not all this does a couple of things. It helps us to create a better course because students are going to be. Posting what they want to learn, and it also gets people aware that we are creating a new course that they might be interested in now, that's the secondary reason, but it's important and it will help when we actually launch a course, because a lot of people, what they do is they create a course on Udemy. They send out a promotional announcement out of the blue and students are like, whoa, there's a new course. I don't know anything about this. I'm going to archive that. But if a month before or a couple of weeks before you were posting about it on social media, there's rules that you you can't just post in to your Udemy students. Hey, I'm creating this new course. Check it out in two weeks. I'll be launching it. But there's ways to to do it within the rules and fairly to your students as well, as long as it's educational. And so if someone knows that, of course, is coming out in the future and then you send them an announcement about it, they're going to be much more likely to enroll. Here's what I mentioned, the photo editing challenge for this month. Everyone kind of downloads this and practices something that I'm going to talk about even more about what I'm doing in the future, but also where I've had a lot of success in the past year or so is hiring people, outsourcing a lot of my tasks. And I'll talk more about this in a second, doing polling. So another thing we're doing is translating a lot of our courses. This is something that I've had a lot of success with. And so I did a poll in my group to see what languages would be the most desired for a translation. And so, see, we got people and this is direct feedback from students who would be actually interested in these different courses. Lots of stuff, lots of cool stuff here, so the key to having success on in a community or a with a Facebook group is to keep it engaging and to you're going to have to work hard at it initially, build up the numbers of students until it can be sort of self-sustaining and self self supportive. In the beginning, I was in there answering all the questions, posting feedback to all of the photos that were being posted by students. And of course, this is going to look different depending on what your topic is. But once there were enough students in this group and they were engaged with the group, I was able to step back. And now the students were supporting themselves. They were posting enough content to keep it engaging. What I did, though, to make sure that I was sane and not going crazy and the students had enough engaging content to to stay in the group and stay active was to come up with a content schedule. So as you saw, we have weekly photo adventures, monthly editing challenges. We have a monthly livestream. We have every other month. We have a photo competition. Doing this stuff keeps the group engaged and all of that. Those posts I can create beforehand and schedule out. So I'm not waking up every day or every Monday thinking, oh, what am I going to be posting in this group? I don't know. I have it all scheduled out. Beforehand, I spent probably a total of of a week or two putting together the content and yes, sometimes I have to record in videos and it's good to pop in there and be fresh and create different content. But a majority of the content has been created maybe months or a year ago and scheduled out. So that's something that I would just think about. And it's been very successful to create an engaged group of students. But also in the long run, it kind of helps our courses because these students are going to much more likely leave better reviews. All right. So what else have we been doing? Videos go online. My brand has gone through a few different iterations. I started it as a way to just share my courses and to with the goal of creating a platform where people can learn skills. I realized that I was putting a lot of effort into the website itself, and I wasn't getting too much return on that investment, it wasn't becoming a website where people were going for specific tutorials or blog articles that I was posting. So instead, I took a step back and I said, OK, what can I do to make this better for the student and what's the purpose of the site? The ultimate purpose is to get people into my courses. How do I do that? Well, I have to have it easily laid out where people can find what they're looking for. So if you go to video school online dotcom right now, there's easy, easy tabs at the top that you can find the category or the topic you're looking for. So, for example, if we go to video, the video page. There is some information at the top with a an email series that we are doing, so this gets people on our email list down below, there are guides. And I have to fix this, this video player right here for sure, this is too big, so always good to check your websites to make sure that things look look good over time with any updates. But here you see all of our main guides. So instead of having a blog with just an endless list of tutorials or guides that aren't really organized, I organized it all by page. So now this page has all of our video related guides and then our courses down at the bottom. Same goes for these other pages of photography. For example, I have an email series down below. We have these guides and a lot of these guides were actually written by someone I hired. I hired a photographer using up workcamps. To write key guides on all kinds of topics, I think she ended up writing 30 or 40 articles for me and she wrote these before I was doing this before my twin boys were born, because what I wanted was I wanted to have a schedule of content that would be released even after my boys were born. And I actually took three months off of work completely. I mean, now I'm spending about 16 hours of a week. Back then when they were born, I was spending maybe one or two hours just checking emails, making sure nothing was broken. But before that, I had outsourced a lot in terms of content creation and then I had scheduled these articles to come out. Now this video is getting really long, but I hope you are enjoying it. I kind of wanted to just include as much information as possible with this update because it is 20/20 coming up and it's the start of a new decade. And a lot has happened since I did a previous update for this course. But again, you can see now all of my courses are listed below. I give people the option to purchase the course on Udemy or through video school online. If they click the videos, go online, link, it will take them to our membership page. So lots of stuff here, so that's pretty much what I want my website to be right now. It's a great resource. There are some articles for the different topics, but ultimately it's it's more of a portfolio of my courses. People who are interested in my courses or are they search for my name or videos, go online because they've heard someone talk about my courses. They can come here and they find, oh, here's all of my courses. Ultimately, though, something that I've been experimenting with and I'm moving towards is creating a separate brand for my photography audience because the audience has grown so much, I'm creating a new website called Photography and Friends. Now, initially, this is just going to be a website. This is not live yet. But it's just going to be a place where I move some of my content that's on videos, go online and replicate it here. And the goal is that I really want this to be the one stop shop for anyone who's interested in learning anything about photography. They can come here. I'm going to have a start here, page with free lessons that I take from my courses and I've listed them out here in an order so people can actually come here and take engage with a lot of content. But of course, this is also going to be promoting my courses for people are interested guides. So again, this is just another place where we can post are our guides because again, to be honest, sometimes I post a tutorial on YouTube, but it doesn't end up on video school online. And it's because videos go online, like I mentioned, has turned more into a portfolio, whereas for photography and friends will become a specific place for tutorials and learning photography skills. In this course, you'll probably hear me talk about how I've always struggled with having a brand that covers so many different topics. And for the longest time I've struggled with and I've said I'm just going to keep video school online, I'm going to put everything under that brand. But at the end of the day, it's easier to have a brand that's focused on one topic area. You can scale bigger, you serve your audience better. And so that's why I'm separating the website out into photography and friends. So this is just another experiment that I'm doing. As you can see, I've had a lot of success with videos go online and what I've done. And now I'm doing a lot of things to just experiment and see what's going to work moving in the future. So I was going down a little bit of a rabbit hole there. But back to what has just worked really well for me over the past few years or even beyond YouTube. YouTube has been a great place for me to just post videos. Of course, videos, but also as free previews, but also separated unique tutorials, you can see here that I have one hundred and thirteen thousand subscribers right now and I'm still posting pretty often. So this was the batch of videos I recorded. So this was a little bit more often than typical. But in the past week, I have like 10 or more videos. But previous to that posting, about once a week or so on average, YouTube is a great place to to start if you're interested in growing a brand off of Udemy or off of your course platform. The other thing that has been super successful for me always has been constructing with with other partners. This has allowed me to expand my topic area, to create courses that I'm not an expert in, but my students are interested in. So if you go to my my Udemy profile, you can see this is a construction light room. That's just me marketing. This is not a construction, but this is a partnership with a Spanish instructor who has translated this course for me. Here are more translations with a partner. Start your photography business. This is a construction, construction, construction. Pretty much everything on this page is a construction except for my content marketing and Lightroom, of course. So you can see that at this point I've created pretty much any course that I can or would want to teach on my own at this point in my career. And so I've expanded and I've continued to part with partner with other instructors. Now, the benefit of this is that not only can we come together, create a brand new course topic, but of course we each will have our own audience that we can promote to. Typically, I'm partnering with instructors who have a lot smaller of our audience right now. I'm actually working with and a couple instructors who have, I think, like less than a thousand students on Udemy, but they have a skill set that I'm interested in and that's 3-D animation and 3D design. So we're partnering together. And that's just been another way that I've continued to expand my course catalog and earn more revenue. So if you're sitting there and you're not sure if you're wondering how can you make more money, why aren't you having enough success, maybe reach out to some other instructors and see if you can partner. And then lastly, just to cover it in a little bit more depth. One thing that I've done over the past couple of years to to help me out and to help my business is outsourced. So first, I hired people to help answer questions on Udemy. So I've gone through several different assistants who have done that. And that was a bit of work to find the right right fit who had the right skills, the right knowledge to to help me out. But I'm very thankful for my all of my assistants who have helped me out there. I've hired a virtual assistant to help me respond to reviews, do things like accept people to my Facebook groups, all of these little things that would take a minute here a minute. They're not much time, but it adds up over the course of a day or a week. And it also just takes up mental space, which was was really frustrating to me when I was, you know, just had my kid, my my twin boys. I'm trying to run this business. At the same time. People are wondering why why can't I join the Facebook group I requested to join a month ago or probably not a month ago, but a week ago. So now I don't even have to think about that stuff. And those are all important things, though, to to help your business grow, to respond to reviews, to respond to questions. I've also outsourced some of my course and video editing, which has been huge for me. Like many people who are starting out, you think that you are the only person that can do a certain thing. As a video editor myself, I thought I'm the only one that can edit my courses. I do it fast anyways. Why would I pay someone to do it? But. Especially with having kids and cutting my work hours, it was necessary if I was going to continue to put out courses, put out YouTube videos and that kind of thing to outsource my some of my editing. So that's been super helpful. Moving on into twenty twenty what and beyond. What are the things that I'm doing to to grow my business even more. I think the key things are more coarse translations, especially going to you to me live this year. I saw that they are continuing to push into other languages. I think a majority of course sales now are are definitely outside of the United States and I'm not sure exactly, but the numbers of courses sold in other languages is huge. And there's a real desire from people to to to have courses in other parts of the world. Now, I've done this a few different ways in the past. I've partnered with other instructors who are already on Udemy. They speak Spanish, for example. We I basically give them the course content and they translate it for me, add subtitles or do a voiceover or sometimes recreate the course from scratch, but in their own language, but using basically my my outline in my script and doing it themselves. And that's typically a split 50 50 revenue. I share it with them and they manage the course after the fact, which is really nice. I've also done it differently where I've paid up front for someone to transcribe and translate that transcription. Then I've gone in and added those subtitles and burned those captions into the video file so that it's there and it's a professional translation. And that's been really good because I get to keep the revenue moving forward. But it's also a lot more work and I have to either myself or one of my assistants has to to support that that course moving forward in a different language. Thankfully, one of my assistants does speak Spanish, German, Italian, so she's helped with some courses. Otherwise you have to rely on Google Translate, which isn't that good, or hiring someone who does speak that language. But my my biggest advice for you would be to to test it out, maybe try it with a couple of your best courses. If you have one best selling course, try it out for me, Portuguese Spanish has worked really well. I have some courses in French, Chinese, Mandarin, Italian that even Polish and some of those have have worked OK. But I would say right now the Spanish and Portuguese markets are huge. But that being said, just like how it was when I was starting out on you, to me, it's good to plant your flag with your course in the beginning because there's some markets that are just getting started and there is not as much competition in different topics in those languages. So you if you can establish yourself as the go to course or go to instructor in those languages, that would be amazing for those other languages. Another thing that I'm doing is making better resources for my courses. So usually I come back from Udemy live and I keep talking about you to me live. But if you don't know what it is, it's a conference that Udemy has just for the instructors. And so you there's lots of sessions on how to create courses, how to promote courses, all kinds of stuff. The best part of is about it is you get to meet other co instructors or other instructors who get you, who understand what you're going through. And you just immediately have this connection with the people that you might see on Udemy, you might see in the different groups or the instructor community. But usually I come back thinking, oh, I am pumped up, I'm going to go create a bunch of new courses. I've got twenty courses that I want to launch next year. This year I came back and I, I didn't want to create a bunch of new courses. What I wanted to do was go back to all of my existing courses and make them even better because even I have a lot of courses that don't rank well for the keyword for their topic and even jumping up definitely to that first page of search results, but also more importantly from, you know, six, seven spot in the list to the top one through five. That's going to help increase your your sales and revenue a ton. And so I'm going back to a lot of my courses, adding practical activities which students like, adding new resources. So I want to show you an example of something that I am doing. This is a template or a SAM. All that I'm working with a designer and she's actually a student of mine, and I hired her through the Facebook group for photography and friends and she's creating sort of this notebook for my courses. And so she's going through each lesson. She's adding key points, some more examples, all kinds of cool stuff. And so I'm going to be doing more of this stuff so that when you enroll in any of my courses, you get an e-book, you get some sort of notebook like this again, just trying to make that course experience even better. And then the last thing I'll say that I've been doing is really solidifying my my launch sequence. So when you when I launch, of course, I want to have a sequence of content that I'm putting out not just with my promotion's on Udemy, but also off platform. So here you can see an example of what I've created. So a month before I'll be posting a video, sending out an email I'm posting on social media, just asking people like we saw in the group what questions they have about this course topic a week before I'll be prepping people with social media graphics on launch day. I have all of this content that I'm putting out. I follow it up after launch day with different emails, videos, and this is this is one of the ways that you have success on YouTube. It's not about just putting out one promo, video, promo, email and expecting to have success. It's about following up. And throughout this course, you're going to watch some videos that I've created in the past talking about my launch sequence, talking about pricing. A lot has changed over over the years. Most recently, Udemy has updated their pricing and their coupon promotion strategy again in late 2019. And I'm kind of waiting to see how that goes, to determine how I promote a new course. And I'll be updating this course if there's anything major that I'm doing differently. But it seems like still we're able to do a discount for a shorter window period. We can't create unlimited free coupons anymore. We can't create unlimited nine dollar and 99 cent coupons with no expiration. There are new rules that have been implemented, but the strategy pretty much remains the same. It's not just about the price. It's it really isn't about the price that someone's going to buy a course from you. It's about whether it's a topic and a skill set they need. It's about how in your promotions you help them understand that by taking your course, what are they going to gain? It's about what they're going to gain and not what they're going to lose. It's not about them losing ten dollars or fifteen dollars or twenty dollars. It's about the skills they're going to gain from you and how that's going to make their life even better. And that's what you have to get across in all of your promotions. So, again, just having a more kind of solidified launch plan, especially as I've continued working with more partners and constructors having this set. So if someone wants to partner with me, they know this is what I'm going to do and they need to be a part of it. Aside from that, expanding my team even more, outsourcing even more, I think that's definitely one thing just to keep the content coming to to make it even better as I continue to spend a lot of time with my family. And that's and I have a baby girl coming in for months now. And so I'm going to be taking off a few months after that just to be with the family. Don't know how it's going to be having a one year old twins or one and a half year old twins with a baby girl as well. But it's going to be a fun adventure. So anyways, I hope this video was helpful. I hope it was inspiring. And I hope that if you're brand new to this course, you are excited to continue with this course. As I mentioned, there are updates to the way that I do things. There are things in this course that might be a little outdated. Please let me know. Message me if there's anything that or post a question if there's anything that seems out of date to you, because I want to make sure that the rest of the content is still applicable. And I say all this knowing that everything that I've done up until this point, most of it still applies to today. So that's why this course, I think, has helped a lot of people get started. And I hope it continues to do so in the future. All right. To 2020 and beyond. Best of luck and thank you so much for enrolling in this class and watching this video. Cheers.

=== Section 2: Validate Your Course Topic and Design an Engaging Course

==== Ideation - Choose a Course Topic

In this lesson you're going to learn how to come up with great course topics whether this is your first course or your next course in your course library. I'm going to talk about big for small courses advanced versus beginner courses and how to put it together with your long term goals. So first what do I suggest creating for your very first course? If you're a brand new course grader and you're trying to think of the very first course that you can teach *what I suggest personally is to just pick something that you love*. The ways you can do this is by just thinking about what you're passionate about, what are your hobbies? what do you do on the weekends? what do you read about? what types of blogs do follow? if you listen to podcast what do you like listening to? what are you like talking about with your family? your friends? What do people ask you to help out with? Just pick something you love and you could do a brainstorm, doing a mind map just writing out a bunch of ideas. That's a great way to just spew out a bunch of ideas and then just pick one. I know this goes against the grain of validating a course idea And we're going to talk about that in the next lesson. But I really believe for your first course, you should just pick something you love for a few reasons: One they're going to have fun doing it and I want you to have fun creating your first course, because if you're not having fun creating courses, you shouldn't be a course creator. There's other ways to make money online other ways to make pasive income and if it's all about the money, then you really shouldn't be in this market, your students are going to understand if you're just creating courses to make money. *So try not to worry about the money. With your first course, just care about creating a great course, you're going to learn how to create videos, how to edit videos if you've never done it before, You're going to learn the platform if you're publishing it on udemy or Skillshare or on your own site, you're going to work out all the kinks with this first course*.

*And I promise you it probably isn't going to be amazing, especially if you continue with this and you look back on it a year or two from now, you're going to look at your first course and be like wow I don't know why anyone enrolled in that class, I need to redo it and through this process you're going to learn how to start building an audience which will help when you start creating your next courses where you do validate the course topic*.

But there are some other things to think about when creating your first courses or your next courses. One is should it be a big 10 1320 hour course even a five-hour course is pretty long for sure, to be a short course and should it be beginner or more of an advanced course, Now first in terms of beginner versus advanced. *I've found a lot of success in creating beginner courses the reason is because there's a bigger audience interested in that topic*. So for example with photography, I have a basic beginner it's the photography masterclass, but it's really geared for beginners because we go from the very beginning, we teach people how to take photos with their camera And we do dive into more advanced topics in that course but it's geared for beginners and that's what a lot of my courses are. There's so many people who have a camera who are interested in learning photography If I would have created a course that was advanced photography techniques or how to be even how to be a professional photographer, there's just not as many people interested in becoming a professional photographer as there are people who just have a camera. Even a smartphone who want to take better photos. *So the audience is bigger for beginner classes*. So I suggest starting with a beginner class because of that reason. But also because you could start to get people in your audience in your student base and later on for your next courses, you can create more advanced courses and you can promote those courses to your current student base, that's how I found a lot of success. So start with a beginner course and then branch off to more advanced or more niche courses. In terms of big versus small courses, the bigger courses not only in length but also in the breadth of what you teach in the course tend to sell more because people see that they have more value, you can make a long course that's boring with lots of rambling and things that don't really matter and it looks long and that doesn't necessarily mean it's a better course but people do perceive longer courses to be more of a value it's just what people see *when they go to a marketplace and they see two courses that are identical with the same rating, with the same target audience with the same title or description, they see that one course is longer than the other, they're most likely going to enroll in the longer course*. That being said, with your bigger or your beginner courses, you want to make sure that they are a little bit bigger. In terms of scope of what you're teaching and also in length. Now how long should your course be for that bigger course? It's hard because different topics take longer to teach. Programming courses take longer than photography courses to get the content across to the viewer some of my photo editing or video editing courses, I'm walking through the entire process which is different than snapping a photo and talking about the settings that I use. And I always encourage people to just take as long as it takes, to teach the course in an engaging way, you don't want your students to be bored, that's going to result in poor reviews which will hurt your course ranking. *So make sure your lessons are engaging but see if you could add extra content more advanced content more projects or practical assignments or exercises or case studies that can add a little bit of meat to your course to make it longer*. For those of you want to take it to the next level and are concerned about validating in the course and making sure you can make money from your courses, watch the next lesson, we'll learn how to validate the market demand for your topic.

==== Validate Market Demand for Your Course

In the last lesson, we talked a lot about coming up with great ideas for your courses. Now let's make sure that those ideas are valid for courses on that there's a demand willing to pay for that course. I do this a number of ways for my upcoming courses because at this point I make sure that the courses will have an audience. And when I started I kind of just created courses on whatever topics whatever I knew, whatever I wanted to talk about and it was a great learning experience but for you to cut out the experimentation, let's learn how to validate. *So the first tools that I use are easy ones YouTube, Amazon, Kindle and Udemy you can go on these websites search for the topics that you're interested in teaching and see is there a lot of content on this topic. if there is, it's a good thing don't be worried if there's other courses in this topic, don't be worried if YouTube has a lot of free videos in this topic, don't be worried if there's a lot of kindle Ebooks on this topic, that means that there's a lot of people watching and looking for this content*. Well make sure that there's views on these videos, make sure that there's reviews on the book. If you search for a topic on Amazon Kindle and there's a lot of books, but none of the books have reviews and that probably means that there aren't that many people looking for that topic, but on the other hand, if you search for a topic there's lots of books with lots of reviews or videos on YouTube with lots of views, then that means that there are people out there and i'm going to dive into this in just a second and show you exactly how I do it but do the same thing on Udemy and sometimes you can find a niche where there isn't a course and that's fine too. There might be an audience if you're going to find a topic that's really popular on kindle and YouTube but there's not courses on udemy or on other marketplaces like Skillshare, there's probably a demand for it. Also just search on Google for topic name online course. So photography online courses or video editing online courses or wedding photography online courses just search and see what's out there. If there are other courses, remember it's actually a good thing.

Now let's dive in and I'll show you exactly how to do this. Let's start out with Amazon and the topic i'm going to be using as an example is calligraphy, something that my wife is interested in. So I want to see if calligraphy is a viable option for creating an online course. So if I type in calligraphy well the first thing you notice in Amazon is that it's going to show up with the actual tools for calligraphy. One of the first options though is this creative lettering and beyond book. Let's search for calligraphy book. So now we see that same book up here at the top we see different books that also have a lot of reviews you know over 250 for reviews over a hundred reviews on Amazon Kindle is a good sign that this is a popular topic. So let me just click open this creative lettering book. So this will be good for later on we're going to use that for another purpose. Now let's go over to Udemy let's type in calligraphy and I also notice that when I typed in creative lettering or calligraphy and Amazon one of these things is lettering creative lettering. That's the keyword hand lettering is another keyword that we might want to search for. On Udemy we see that the first thing I want to look is how many search results are there, just one page of search results which means that there aren't actually that many courses on this topic on Udemy. So that's a good or bad sign, we don't really know yet because not that many courses means that it could just be a topic that doesn't sell well on Udemy but it also could mean that it is a topic that needs more courses. *Next I actually want to search for this in Skillshare because I know Skillshare probably has a lot of calligraphy classes or hand lettering classes because it's a more arts creative base platform and it makes sense that it would do really well on Skillshare*. So it doesn't necessarily mean that it's going to do well on Udemy But you can see there that there were 121 courses in calligraphy and just with these top courses we have 15,000 students 5,000 students, these are a lot of students especially for Skillshare class. So this is a good sign that it's a great topic for a course and maybe just Udemy doesn't have the course on there yet. But that's not the last thing we're going to do, we're going to look on youtube to see if there are calligraphy tutorials. So let's just search calligraphy and you can see that there are a lot of tutorials there are a lot of views on these tutorials millions of views on these introductory tutorials, which is a good sign, this means that there's a lot of people looking to get started with calligraphy and then I'm just going to search for hand lettering just to see. So hand lettering is a smaller more niche topic and you can see that there are actually fewer views there are still a lot of views. So it is still definitely a topic that is worthwhile But it's a little bit different than calligraphy and I don't honestly know that ins and outs of what's the difference between hand lettering versus calligraphy is it might just be that you can do hand lettering with non calligraphy pens but it's also an option just knowing that in the Amazon search results that the key word that popped up for the best-selling book was also hand lettering not just calligraphy I think the fact that there is only one page of results just shows that there's an opportunity for someone here. So if you're listening to this and you do calligraphy you might want to hop on board and start teaching calligraphy on udemy.

Another tool that I use is the google keyword planner you will need an AdWords account to use the *google keyword planner* and you can sign up for free with a gmail account once you dive into the google keyword planner, you can search for course topics keywords basically, you can see how many people are searching for that topic per month. Again if there's lots of people searching for that topic and it's a good idea to create a course idea to create a course on that topic, even using *google trends* you can see trending topics or search within a topic for trending related to that topic. So let's dive in again to see exactly how I do that with google keyword planner and Google Trends with the google keyword planner I want to see how many people are searching for these topics. So we're going to use calligraphy as our topic. So under this find new keywords and get search volume data when you open up the keyword planner tool I just type in the keyword calligraphy and click get ideas what this shows me is that here with our search term that we typed in calligraphy that there are 100 thousand to a million searches on an average month and the competition is low. That actually means that there is space for someone to get into this industry and dominate this industry because the actual price for this keyword for advertising for this keyword is generally low. Sometimes having a higher suggested bid for the ad is a good thing if you're trying to make money from your ads on YouTube or on your blog or website through ads then the higher the price and that means that if you can rank high in google and people are clicking on your video ads or your web ads and you're going to make a lot more money, but when there is a low suggested bid and low competition, that means there's space for someone like you to get in here and rank higher more easily than a highly competitive niche- So here we also see calligraphy writing calligraphy set, so it's probably a good idea to look for calligraphy tutorial to see how many people are searching for calligraphy tutorials. So it's a little bit lower and you see here learn calligraphy is another one. So this is a good way to also come up with ideas for a naming your course not just to see if it's a valid idea but also naming because if you can rank for the term learn calligraphy or calligraphy or calligraphy for beginners isn't as good as learn calligraphy. So you definitely want to use those keywords in your title sub titles and descriptions, we'll talk more about that later. I'm also going to just search for hand lettering just to see what that brings up 10,000 to 100,000. So just based off of what we knew before with the youtube search we knew it was going to be a popular search but still enough to I would say anything above 10,000 or really around that 100,000 mark might be a better good enough topic to create a course on with Google Trends. Let's just see what these topics are doing lately. You can see basically one is just what said trending topics of the day are or if you type in a search option up here or a keyword up here, it will show the popularity of a topic, so you can see that over the past five years or so that calligraphy has become more and more popular with hand lettering. You can see that where there was really not much traffic, not many search or interest in this topic five years ago. But now there's a spike in this topic. So it's a really great time to get into the hand lettering game whether you're doing that as a business or teaching it because there's probably a lot of people interested and learning it to provide an example of a topic top might not be worth creating a course on. I chose the topic juggling it's something that just right off the bat I'm guessing might not have as big of an audience in terms of someone willing to pay for a course on YouTube. There are a lot of free tutorials on juggling. So this is where it's tricky you have to kind of balance both the views on YouTube with potential for a paying course when you search on Udemy yes there are there is a page full of juggling But there's actually only a few juggling courses. the other ones are about juggling your workload. But you can see that there are only a few ratings on these courses versus the other one. Let's just type in say web development we know that web development is a topic that's much desired right now and you have these web development courses that have thousands and thousands and hundreds of reviews. So this shows you that there are people actually engaging with the course and more people buying the course same with Google Trends, you type in juggling the interest in juggling is unfortunately declining. Beyond making sure that there's an audience for your topic, you can use these tools to come up with the key selling points and the key point you should include in your course. Let me tell you a story, one day I was making sure that my courses were ranking high on Udemy So I searched for Adobe Premiere Pro funny I see this course that has the exact same title of mine I click on it just to see, I see hmm this is interesting the outline is exactly the same as mine So I play the intro video and I see another instructor introducing the course they say from that's a coincidence or maybe we just great minds think alike then I go back to the sales page and I see that the course description and subtitle are exactly word for word copied from my course they even included my name which was in the course description talking about the instructor do you not do that, that is just very unethical. So I'm not saying doing that but I'm saying that you can go on Udemy to see what the best selling courses in your topic are teaching how they are selling you know reading the description of the subtitle and really understanding what students are looking for in that course or going to Amazon and seeing the best selling book in your topic and seeing what does the course description or the book description say about the book it'll give you ideas for what to include in your course. So these are the ways to validate your course idea and to start coming up with great ideas for what to include in your course. Thanks for watching. I hope this helped and we'll see you in another lesson.

====  Outline an Engaging Course

Now you have your course idea, The next step is outlining a course and making an engaging outlining how do we build the course structure so that students go through it, feeling like they are learning, and getting their money's worth. really matching their expetations getting back to they key concept which will help you get better reviews of matching their expetations.

So the *first thing* I want to drill into your mind is to get into the learning in a intro video, you want to make sure that you explain who this course is for, a quick little bit about yourself, *usually for most of my classes, I have two to three sentences about my background so that students can trust that I'm a good instructor for that topic*. And then you want to get straight into some quick wins, So this could be a separate lesson or within that very first lesson might be a good idea for you to have some sort of key learning points that will actually have students take aways something that they didn't know before. it can also be a separate lesson, a quick win lesson, something in the second or third video of the course where you teach them something practical about your topic So it doesn't necessary have to be in the order of the entrire learning process, But something that impresses them and make them say: Wow I'm learning something in this class. and seems like I'm going to learn about more. So for an example in my Adobe Premire Pro video editing class, which is meant for complete begginers, in the second lesson we actually learn how to stabilize shaky footage using an effect. Now this is some effect that we talk about later in the course. but teaching somethin where someone who learns that, says wow that's really cool I didn't know that I could do that in Premiere Pro. They learn something practical and it makes them think: Wow this course must be really good because I'm going to continue with it and learn a lot. And another reason why getting straight into the learning is important is to help you get better reviews especially on udemy we're at this current time, students get prompted to review the course, sometimes, after the second or third lesson. *you want to make sure that it's not just a bunch of introductory stuff where it's too basic and it's not really learning they'll be more likely to give you a better review, if you have some sort of quick win in that first section*. So that's how you start a course with an introduction and then some sort of quick win. *Another thing I like to include in the first section are any bonus materials*. So if I have added a PDF or sometimes I make an audio version of the course, I'll put that in the first section then for the rest of the course I just break down the sections by sort of overarching concept and then within those sections I have the individual lesson and each individual lesson is a new skill that they can learn or some sort of step of the process each lesson. I try to make between four and seven minutes long some maybe longer, some maybe shorter But again going back to the idea that it should only take as long as it takes to teach the concept. *Udemy and other places have done research and that you found that four to seven minutes is a good length for an online course lesson*. Anything more can start to get drawn out and boring and students lose focus but anything shorter students will not really be able to learn the full concept it'll just feel a little bit too short so between four and seven minutes or somewhere around there is a good length to aim for for your lessons again it's by no mean a commandment that you have to do this but it's what I found to be successful *I urge you to have some more engaging lesson types like exercises or assignments and then quizzes*. So most platforms allow you to create quizzes within your courses. This is a great way just to reinforce some of the key concepts of what you're teaching them, *don't make them too hard or too easy, if it's too hard people are going to get frustrated, if it's too easy people will just feel like: Well that was pointless and a waste of time*. with exercises or assignments, there's different ways to do this, you can either prompt a student to do something, go take a photo outside at night and expose it properly, edit this piece of video into a shorter interview for this class it might be introducing yourself to your fellow students and then later on, show them how to do it. So first prompt and then show them how to do it, or another structure of an exercise is to show them how to do it then prompt them to do it themselves and then perhaps even follow up with another example of how you did this and an example of this would be with a portrait photography class of mine where we showed them how to shoot photos outside using a flash and then we prompt them to do it themselves and then we follow it up with another example of how to do it ourselves. So explain prompt and then review and then just one quick tip for when you're actually writing out your outline and coming up with lesson and section titles is to try to make them action-oriented. So for example for this lesson it's outlined an engaging course instead of how to outline an engaging course or outlining or something boring like that but it's an action outline and engaging course. Now I'm not just doing this because it sounds cool. *Im doing this because researchers and Udemy specifically has said that lesson title that have that action oriented verb in the beginning tend to do better and to encourage students to continue with the course again if we get students to continue with the course and watch more content, it probably means we're going to get better reviews*. But also that engagement and that watch time does have to do with search ranking, on most platforms anyways. *So action-oriented titles*.

==== CASE STUDY: Outlining a Course

Here's a case study for how to outline an engaging course. I'm going to be doing case studies throughout this course to teach you how to do the topics that I'm teaching you about. In the last lesson, I talked about what to do but I actually want to show you how to do it. So that you're learning better from examples. At least that's how I learned so I hope this helps you. So I just create my outlines in Google Drive actually and this is a collaboration with a couple of my buddies Will and Sam on a course about video lighting. So more advanced course for video production lighting. So you can see we have our full outline right now just with our course lectures and these section titles so far and later on we're going to go in and actually write out each for each lesson, the bullet points for each lesson and even some talking points or perhaps even script this one out but I want to show you in particularly the first section and how we're making this course more engaging So with the first lesson what we're going to do is welcome people to the course, explain what it's about, but also while we're doing this, we're going to show a comparison with and without lighting because we want to make this first lesson prove to the person who just bought the course why lighting is good. And I think by showing with or without well we're not necessarily teaching them how to light in that very first lesson, we're showing them why you light. So I think that will be pretty cool we're going to keep it very short, very quick. And then with the rest of these lessons in the first section we're kind of just jumping right out them with some quick wins. So the second lesson is better lighting for $25. We want to show them that they can make that their videos look amazing with DIY lighting that you might even have at your house and with this we're going to include a PDF download with the equipment list and some photos and images for the equipment that you would need to get this great lighting setup for $25. The next lesson is going to be the magic of backlighting. So this is a more advanced tip you know we're not starting from the very beginning of what is a light? or what types of light bulbs are? or what is color temperature? That's going to come later But that's a little bit boring at the start. So we want to show them some quick tips. And so this one is going to show what a backlight is and why it's so awesome. Basically, even using any type of light not a professional but even a DIY backlight too. And then, we're going to give one other tip for making people look better and I chose this title because it's a little mysterious one simple trick to make people look better. Because I don't know, If I was taking this class I'd be oh what is that trick? I think it's a little mysterious and would want to make me watch this lesson. and of course, we have to back it up with a great content that actually does make people look better. and we have a trick that we can teach people to again use and do with really whatever lighting kit they have, it doesn't have to be professional. So that's the first section and then we go into the fundamentals. And so you can see that we go into the fundamentals. Then we start with DIY lighting, Then we go into professional lighting. And then we go into actual lighting setups. So lighting people, lighting in the real world, and then more creative lighting. So we do start from the basics and then move to more professional and people can kind of jump around if they want. If they want to skip DIY lighting, they can but in the very beginning we're giving them some awesome content for someone that's brand new to lighting to make them feel like they're already learning something at the very start of the course. So that's just an example of what I'm doing. I hope this helped. If you have any questions, let me know. Otherwise, we'll see you in the next lesson and a future case study.

==== To Script or Not to Script - That is the Question

So it is kind of like a script in the sense that I actually write out.

The key talking points even sometimes full sentences.

=== Section 3: Create You Amazing Course

==== Choose a Course Style

Welcome to this new section where we will be talking about creating your course. We are going to cover everything from the beginning to the end. And first we're starting with the different types of video lessons that you might want to create for your own course and knowing which type of video lesson you want to create, will help determine everything from what types of equipment do you need, If you need to design slides and all that we're going to be talking about later on. So let's run through the key and the most popular types of lessons.

The *first and most basic type* is a slideshow with a voiceover. This is great for beginners, it's great for some kinds of courses where it's not really practical skills where you're teaching someone how to do something like programming or how to bake bread. These are great for beginners, they're easy to produce they are the quickest way to produce a course And you need the least amount of equipment, basically a laptop and a microphone. You can design slides for free using tools like canva or Google slides or you could use something like PowerPoint or keynote on your computer. The con of this type of lesson is that it's very easy to get boring depending on the way you design your slides and depending on how well you are has someone speaking being engaging as just a voice rather than sawn on camera and a voice it can get a little bit boring fot the student. So well it's a great way to start out. As you move further in your online course creation journey, I encourage you to do some of these other styles of lessons.

*The second is video* with slides and that's what I'm doing a lot of with this course. Me on camera talking head and then I add slides or graphics. Now it could just be a full frame slide or it could be a graphic that pops up next to me. This is great because being on camera just is a little bit more engaging with students. I know that my students like my courses where I am on camera better and you have to do less work with the slides I do not like designing slides. Now I know how to make engaging slides and I've learned how to do that. but it's still one of my least favorite things to do, being on camera, allows you to create have to use less slides and make your slides more simple because you're going to be on camera most of the time and you can be engaging on camera with the audience. And being on camera it's just a direct connection with a student looking at the camera. I'm looking at you I'm connecting with you even though I'm not doing this live with you, I'm still trying to connect with you personally, it's just something about looking at the camera, eye contact, that helps with that it does take a little bit more work. You need a webcam or a camera to get good quality, maybe even some lighting maybe a different type of microphone. All things we're going to be covering in the next lesson with my recommended equipment. Taking it a step further another type of lesson is just video base where you're on camera demonstrating something. Now this is probably the most amount of work in creating a course or it's just you on camera. But if you are teaching something like something with your hand or how to even take better photos or how to cook or there's all kinds of things where you have to actually see someone doing it to, learn it properly, it's better to do it on camera rather than just with a bunch of slides. Teaching a dog obedience class is going to be a lot better if you're on camera with a dog showing the audience, showing the students what to do and seeing the dog's reaction, seeing exactly what you're doing, it's going to be a lot better than if you're just showing some pictures or not even pictures just using some text on a slide. Yes it is more work, but I would say it's a requirement for courses where you're demonstrating you have to demonstrate something on camera. And then the last type is a screencast style tutorial where you're showing someone something you're demonstrating something. But it's on the computer, so sometimes you can add graphics and slides to this as well. But most of the time it's just you walking through something on the computer, it could be web development, programming, how to use a video editing application. Really use any application on the computer, screen casting is a very easy way to do it and there's lots of tools out there that allow you to do it for free or for very cheaply that I'll talk about in the next lesson. So those are the four basic types of lessons. Start to think about what lesson type fits best for your course. And then we're going to talk about equipment. So you know exactly what I recommend for each lesson type.
