== YouTube Masterclass - Your Complete Guide to YouTube - Phil Ebiner

=== Section 1: Introduction - Start Here

==== Welcome to the Course

Welcome to the YouTube master class. We are so excited that you took action, enrolled in this class and we can't wait to help you have more success on YouTube, whether you're a complete beginner or you already have a channel up and running in this video, I just want to briefly cover the roadmap to your success and how you can have the most success with this course.

*First*, let's get started with the goal that I have for you in this class, and that goal is to help you use YouTube successfully to achieve your own goals. Okay, that's a little bit funny, right? We want to help you achieve whatever goal you have on YouTube, whether that's becoming a YouTube star, making money on YouTube or just simply understanding how to use the platform. Whatever your goal on YouTube is, we hope that this class can help you achieve that. To make sure that this course is most beneficial for you, I want to briefly go over the course structure. We've ordered it in the way that we think is most helpful if you are brand new to creating a YouTube channel. So the first sections are great for beginners. We show you what equipment we recommend. So while this isn't a course that's going to teach you how to make videos, we have other courses on that topic. We do want to cover what type of equipment we recommend for YouTube video creation. We go over how you start your channel from scratch, how to upload videos properly, and basically how to use the YouTube platform. So the back end, the settings, those kinds of things, the later sections of this course are a little bit more advanced. So if you already have a channel up and running, you might want to actually just go ahead and skip to these sections. There's one section that's all about how you grow your channel, and this is probably very interesting for most of you. These are all the best practices to help grow your channel and get more views, get more subscribers, things like that. We go over how you can make money on YouTube, how to do live streaming, and also how to use analytics to grow your channel. So as I mentioned, feel free to jump around from section to section or lesson to lesson. How can you have the most success in this class if you are completely new to YouTube? We recommend watching this entire course all the way through. While you're watching it, we want you to take action. So when we're doing things like starting a channel, creating channel, are designing our channel, start taking action and doing those things after each of those lessons. And at the end of the day, please ask questions if there's anything you need help with. We are here to help if you also have any other suggestions for improvement or things like that for this class. If there's things that we missed in YouTube or on the platform, please let us know. We'd be happy to add content to make this the best course for aspiring YouTubers. And lastly, who are we? Who are you going to be listening to in this class and why should you listen to us? My name is Phil Ebner. I'm the founder of Video School Online, and that's what my channel is all about. My co instructor is Mike Moyer, who has started the Mike and Lauren Channel. We both have channels with over 100,000 subscribers, and everything we teach in this class is based off of our own experience growing our channel. While we do have lots of research and we watch successful YouTubers with more and less subscribers than us, this course is based off of what we've done. There are lots of courses on how to have success on YouTube out there, but many of them are from people who have never had success themself. They are just using other people as examples. So one of the best things about this course is that you get real world tactics and strategies that actually work. In the next lesson, we're going to dive deeper into why YouTube is the best platform for you and a little bit more into seeing our success.

==== Why YouTube + How we are successful on YouTube

Why are YouTube and our success stories in this lesson? I just want to go over why I think YouTube is the best platform to be on. Obviously you are in this class, so you have interest in video creation and YouTube, so you probably know why YouTube is a great platform, but I'll go over my reasons and then we're just going to go into a little bit more detail of our success. I'm just going to show you our channel and talk about kind of the things in a low key manner of what I've done to have success. And of course, this is just going to be like a brief overview of all my strategies, and we're going to dive deeper into all of those throughout this entire course. *First, though, why YouTube? YouTube is great because I believe video is the most engaging form of content*. It's the best way to connect with an audience. You're getting audio, you're getting video. It's face to face. Typically, it's better than a written article. And while podcasting and audio content is great, video has that engagement. That's like on a next level where you can actually see and hear the person. And with the new features of live streaming on YouTube, you can really connect in that moment with your audience. YouTube is the best place to grow a community for video creators. That's what YouTube is all about now. It's all about that connection with your viewer, and that's why I'm a subscriber to all the channels that I subscribe to, because I want that connection with that person. I feel that connection with that person. And that's what makes most channels successful, really figuring out how to build that connection with your viewer. And then just more on a technical standpoint,*YouTube is the second largest search engine*. What that means is that millions of people, billions are searching for things on YouTube every day. And of course, *YouTube is owned by Google*. And so results from YouTube are going to show up in Google results as well, which is the first ranked search engine. So if people are searching for any type of content, they'll likely find some sort of result on YouTube. No matter what topic your videos are on, you can find an audience that wants that kind of video on YouTube a little bit more about my success story. I started my YouTube channel in 2012. It really hasn't been a main focus of mine, so that's one thing to note about my success on YouTube is that if I had focused my full time attention on being a YouTuber, I would have had a lot more success up to this point. But like many of you, I have a lot of other things going on. I have a full business to run, I have a family to feed and to be with. And so YouTube is not my full life. It's really just something that's on the side. But by implementing all of the strategies that we go over in this course, I've been able to have a lot of success. So don't think that you have to be spending 40 hours a week creating YouTube videos to be successful. You can also do this on the side. It's just about figuring out and using the techniques that we cover in this class so that you have the most bang for your buck. So you get the most success out of anything you do on YouTube. What I basically do and it comes down to is posting weekly. So I do try to post weekly videos, but sometimes I'm batch recording videos so that I create a bunch of lessons in one month and then I post them and I schedule them over the next couple of months. *I like to create content that is search friendly and evergreen, meaning that it's not going to be out of date the next day*. So while some YouTube channels are great at posting Daily News friendlies sort of on the topic videos, my videos are more about how to tutorials and content that will be searchable and valid, not just today, but for years to come. Since I've started, I've wanted to use YouTube to help make money for my business, both on the platform and off the platform. So slowly, my ad revenue on YouTube has grown, and that grew up to over $1,000 per month. Now, again, this was just on the side, so 12,000 plus dollars a year was a pretty good amount of money made from ad revenue. Recently, I started taking ads off of my videos because I felt like it was a better viewing experience for my channel viewers to not have to watch ads. And so my ad revenue has decreased. I left ads on some of my most popular videos which were making the most money. So I'm still making 400 and $500 a month on YouTube via their ads. And now each month I'm making thousands of dollars from my YouTube audience, whether that's people finding classes through video descriptions, clicking on cards, or just people becoming aware of my business. Through YouTube, going to my website and finding products that way. So there's lots of different ways you can make money on YouTube, and we're going to cover those later in the course. So let's go ahead and look at my channel just so you can see it and feel free to subscribe to to check it out. And that's one of the best ways that you can learn to, is just by subscribing and following other YouTubers to see what they do. So here we are on my channel. You can see that I do have over 100,000 subscribers I passed out recently and it's one of the reasons I thought it's a great time to update this course because we have made a lot of changes to the channel and things on YouTube are different. I have rebranded my channel from video school online to Phil Ebner. That's a recent change that I've made and a lot of other YouTubers have made. YouTube, a lot of YouTubers have a lot of success with that, the branding of their channel as themself and not as their brand name. And so I followed that trend myself. You can see on my channel we're going to go over all of this stuff, but you can see popular uploads. Some of them are about personal finance, which is kind of funny. And that's, I guess, one mistake that I can say really quickly up front is that to have more success, I would focus your energy on creating a channel on one topic in one niche. I've created videos on all kinds of things and you can see that by clicking on my playlist. You can see that I have playlists on all kinds of things photography, video production, teaching, online, WordPress, personal finance. And so that's why this channel has converted from more videos go online to fill out banner because I use it as a place to basically create videos on whatever I'm interested in here. You can see some of the analytics from my lifetime as a YouTuber. You can see that I started on December 17th, 2012. Today, when I'm recording this, it's February 10th, 2019. I have over 836 videos. And you can see it's kind of hard, hard to see these graphs, but I get this nice growth. A couple of years ago I had a couple more viral videos that did really well, and so that's where you see some peaks over here. But it's amazing. 34000000 minutes of content. Watch. That's just astounding. You can see my total estimated revenue from YouTube here as well. And you can see some of my most popular videos down below one video that has reached a million views. And this is one other thing to just know is that I have had success on YouTube without viral hits. I do not make viral hits. I just make consistent content that is helpful. And over time, a lot of these videos do end up getting tens, hundreds of thousands of views. But it's not like you need one viral hit to have success on YouTube. Now, really quickly, I want to show you Mike and Lauren's channel. So here you can see their channel. They're almost at 150,000 subscribers. So if you're watching this, go over and subscribe to their channel. And I'm sure by the time you watch this, they'll probably have over 150,000 subscribers. Mike and Lauren are a husband and wife team that have made a ton of great videos on all things related to personal finance, DIY. Mike does some sort of construction kind of projects that are really cool. They have some more viral hits than I have, so you can see they have a couple of these kind of projects, DIY project videos that have over a million views lately. They've started doing a lot of sort of personal finance experiments, so their latest series of videos is on RV investments. But basically they were able to retire early with through different types of investments and things like that, and so they make videos on all of those kinds of videos. So you can see here what they do really well is coming up with style for their thumbnail. But you can see here that they're not the kind of channel that's posting every single day or every week. They're posting about one video a month. At times they were a little bit more consistent with their channel, but now it really is just once a month or so. But you can still have success with that. And again, that's one of the things. It's like you don't have to be posting every single day to have success on YouTube. You can do this on the side. Mike and Lauren are retired early, so he doesn't want to be spending 40 hours a week posting to YouTube videos unless that was his main passion. Hopefully you can use the success you see that we've had on YouTube for inspiration for your own channels. All right. Are you ready to start your YouTube channel? We'll see you in the next lesson to get started.

==== YouTube Update from Phil

Hey, Phil, here and in this video, I'm going to be updating you on where I'm at with my video school online YouTube channel and also where I'm at with YouTube in general. I think it's beneficial just to get updates periodically to see what's working, what's not working. And I've got some also exciting news and major changes about how I'm going to run my business and my personal YouTube life. So just to catch everyone up, I started my YouTube channel probably in 2012 for my business video school online. It has since become video school and that's my new brand. And on YouTube, I used it as a place to post tutorials related to my online classes to help drive business to my online classes. But at the same time, the YouTube channel sort of morphed into an a catchall for for all of my video content. And I did that because it was having a lot of success. Currently, I'm almost at 140,000 subscribers, and so I felt like, well, I'm just going to continue to post all my videos there because there's going to be that's where those videos are going to have the most success. And I didn't want to be managing multiple accounts or things like that. That being said, some of the advice that we give in this class and that I try to give others on a lot of things is that it's to have the most success and the most growth. You want to pick a niche, pick a niche, whatever you want to say and stick with it. Because when someone joins, for example, when someone subscribes to a YouTube channel because they watched a certain topic of a video, they are expecting that kind of video. And when I'm running a channel and I'm putting all kinds of content on there that might not be related to why a specific subscriber joined my channel. The views don't go up as much as they should. The watch time doesn't go up because people's expectations aren't being matched. So I've done a lot of great things with this channel, had a lot of success and have continued to have success. And I think moving forward I'll have even more success because what I've actually decided is to split this channel and create my own personal channel, if you remember. And I think some of this course you'll see that I actually for a while changed the video school on video school channel to my personal Phil Ebner channel. I got verified and everything was having a lot of success there. But at the same time, what the channel was was truly not the Phil Ebner channel. It was still mostly video school content tutorials regarding photography, video production, after effects, motion graphics, that kind of thing. And so I have actually decided to let go of that verification. I switched the channel back to video school. I'm leaving this channel as the video school channel where I'll continue to post that kind of content. But I'm starting my own personal channel, or actually I have a very old channel that I started that I'm going to start posting to so you can see it here. The Phil Ebner Channel zero videos as of this recording. But today I'm launching two videos. My first two videos for my personal channel. One is a documentary style vlog about baking sourdough, so completely random compared to what my other channel was, a video that probably wouldn't do well on that channel. But for my personal channel, I'm super excited because it's it's now a place where I can get creative and post the content that I want to make. And so I've spent the past month documenting this challenge that I've been doing myself of baking 30 loaves of sourdough bread in 30 days, and I am posting a video about that. I'm doing a premiere, which is one of YouTube's relatively new features, just where you can actually launch a video and sort of promote it ahead of time and try to get people to watch it together live. And so I'll be interested to see how that goes. I'm also launching another video. It's a Q&A, Ask Me Anything video where I posted on my social media accounts, asked people if they had questions for me, and I'm answering 30 questions in that video. So both of those are going up today when I'm launching this. So I'm super excited to see how those do and just excited to see how the channel does. Because I think what I realize is that. From my video school channel, there was a certain segment of people who wanted to follow my personal journey and wanted to see the behind the scenes of what I was doing, why I was doing things. Get to know me more on a personal level, which is what there's a lot of beauty in that and YouTube allows us to do. But there was a large percentage of people who just didn't care about that. And you can actually see this in the stats. So I don't mean to be super critical on myself because I think a lot of people might say, Oh, well, you're having a lot of success, 140,000 subscribers, you're making over $1,000 a month in ad revenue, 1000 new subscribers a month. You know, in total, I think my channel has let's go to my actual channel and see how many views I have. Almost 20 million views of my my videos. So a lot of success. But at the same time, when I'm posting new videos, I realize that I'm not getting the engagement that I wish. And that's because I think that over time, people lost interest in my channel, even if they're subscribers, because I wasn't putting out the content that they imagined. Let's go look at my subscribers in a little bit more depth just to see over time what's happening. So you can see here, I started back in 2012 and it took a while to get to that magical first 1000 subscribers. It looks like I hid that about three years later. I wasn't focusing and I've never really focused a ton of energy on YouTube. It's always been sort of like something that, you know, I post my videos there, I'm consistent at it, but I'm not I'm not a YouTuber in that sense. And I think that's the beauty of what I teach in this class. And what you can do is like you don't have to be a YouTuber to have success. But at the same time, if you want to be at the top of the YouTube game, you do have to be the YouTuber and that has to be like a main focus of your content, but was getting a lot of subscribers and then it sort of peaked. You know, I got 5000 subscribers in a month in December 2016 and then it just sort of. Sort of leveled off and wasn't getting. I had a big spike here. I was giving away a bunch of free courses, which, you know, is great to get more subscribers because I was giving away free courses. But that quality of subscriber isn't that great. And then so I'm going back down here to 1000 subscribers a month at this point in time. So obviously something's not working. I think the main thing is I'm just not putting out as much content on here, but I also haven't been putting out the quality of content that I think I need to sustain this growth and this kind of growth here. Just with views, let's go back to my views and we'll see that over lifetime because earlier on I was putting out some really high quality views videos. Here. Around the same time when I was getting that spike in subscribers and I was getting a lot more views. And so over time I've kind of maintained the number of views per month. That's because I've continued to put out video content. So just the number of videos in my library, people end up finding them. But again, not growth like no one wants to see this growth just plateau and everything has sort of plateaued at this point. We can look at revenue. Let's see this and over time. Same thing sort of plateaued. That's grown a little bit. There was this weird dip here. All of the ads on my channel stopped running, and so I had to contact Google and they just fixed it. They didn't say why it happened, but I was like, That's a very sad mistake to make to if someone's depending on their YouTube revenue and then it just ads stop running on their channel for no apparent reason. And then lastly, let's look at Watch Time, which is such an important metric. Same thing, Spike and then plateau. So what I'm learning, I guess the takeaways for this video to learn from my success and my failures is to understand that. Quality, I think over anything right now, quality is better than quantity in terms of you have to put it the time into making a high quality video. It's not just about putting out as much content as possible. If you put out fewer videos, but higher quality content, you're going to see more growth, see more people latch on for a while. You know, the trend was to do these daily vlogs. And while that's a great way to try to ramp up your your subscribers and your channel, it's most likely going to be unsustainable for many people. And so doing like the daily vlog style thing is a very tough thing to do for channels to put out daily content unless you have a team behind you. So I would say don't worry about that. I'm going to be sharing more about my experience, about this experience with my personal channel and I'll see how it goes. I encourage you to go check it out. Of course, I would love your support to watch the videos and subscribe. If you do want to learn more about my personal life, see what I'm doing, I'll probably putting out be putting out 1 to 2 videos per month, but again, hopefully higher quality and hopefully based off of the first one that I'm putting out later on today as I'm recording this, my sourdough bread video, you'll see that kind of quality level and what I'm aiming to achieve. I've been inspired by a lot of other YouTubers lately, like Jonny Harris is Harris, Nathaniel Drew, these people that are putting out super high quality videos. So is it too late to get into the YouTube game? Not at all, because people are still jumping in and having a ton of success. And it's not about, you know, getting millions of subscribers to have success. You can have success with 1000 subscribers. With 100 subscribers. You just need people who are engaged with you as a person or a brand and you can have a lot of success. So anyways, if you have questions, make sure that you submit them. You can reach out to me, ask me on my Instagram. That's probably the best way to connect with me or of course on the YouTube channel as well. So thank you so much. Have a beautiful day and best of luck with the rest of the class by.

==== How to Start a YouTube Chanel

* Create Gmail account and create YouTube channel. Period.

==== YouTube Channel Art & Profile Icon

In this lesson. We're going to be updating your channel icon and channel art. So here on YouTube, this is your channel and right now it's pretty boring. So the first thing we're going to do is add some channel artwork and change your profile icon. So to adjust your profile icon, if you click the little camera button, when you hover over the profile image, it's going to tell you that you edit this on your Google account. So just click edit and it's going to take you to your Google account. So from here you can upload a photo. So let's find a photo of me. I got some headshots that I've used in the past. So here I'm just going to upload this headshot photo. And this is going to be my icon across the board now in terms of what you want to choose for your profile image. I would choose something like a picture of you. If it's a channel about you, a personal channel or your logo, if you are a brand. Now I'm going to click Done. Unless you want to crop it there. And now this should save. So we're going to go back to our YouTube channel. Okay. So notice how right now it hasn't updated. It might take a minute or two for it to update. So in the meantime, we're going to go ahead and look at customizing our channel art. But first, I want to just talk quickly about what you should be looking to do in your channel art. And I'm going to use myself as an example. So here's the channel art for my channel. You can see that I have my image here, I have my name. A couple of words about what this channel is about and then also my logo. Now, the reason I have my name and my logo is because this channel actually originally started out as the video school online channel. *I've noticed over the past few years, and especially since I launched this course the first time that there's been a move towards YouTube being a place for your personal brand and not necessarily your business brand unless you are a full blown business with lots of lots of different people*. So me as an solo entrepreneur with my own business, video school online on YouTube, it makes more sense to try to grow a channel that is the Phil Ebner channel, then the video school online channel, because people on YouTube are trying to connect with individuals. That's what they want. They want that connection with people. And that's why I've seen all kinds of people who have big brands name their YouTube channels as their personal name. Some things and strategies I've seen in channel art that works is including things like the schedule of your videos. So some people will say weekly videos or new videos on Tuesdays or video video tips on videos on Tuesday, tutorial vlog videos Fridays or something like that, so that when someone comes to your channel, they automatically see and know what your channel is about. And that's really the goal with your channel is for them to know what it is about. So even though someone might come here and say, okay, well, this is Phil Ebner, who's this? Who is this guy with this text down here? Video photo in business, you'll know what I'm about. If I didn't have this text, maybe I would just include images of like video production or photography stuff in the background. So how do we create our channel art?

*First you have to click Customize Channel*, and this is going to convert this channel into a customizable channel similar to mine. And you can see when I do that, our profile icon is automatically updated as well. We can. Take this menu on the left, in and out if we want. Next, you're going to click Add Channel Art. All right. So we can go ahead and just upload photo if we have one. But it's a very specific size of art and placement of art that you'll want to use. So to get a template or for more instruction, click this How to Create Channel Art Button. And this has actually some more instructions and a template. So if you scroll down, get images for channel art, where is this template? There's a template somewhere. Here we go. So if you drop down image size and file guidelines, if you download this channel art templates file, it's going to be a zip file with different images in it that you can use. So let me go ahead and open that up. So once you open that up, you have a PNG file. This is great. If you're using any sort of photo editor or graphic editor, you can add this and use it as a template or there's an actual Photoshop file if you want to use Photoshop. Now we're not going to use Photoshop. I use Photoshop personally, but it is a little bit advanced. So we're going to use another tool called Canva.com. I'll show you really quickly how easily it is to create channel art here. Here, I'm logged in to my video school online account and you can see all the different types of graphics I've created. I've actually used Canva.com to update my YouTube channel art recently, as you can see here, and you can see here how the dimensions and the template come in handy, because here I was able to use the template to know exactly where I should place this text and this image in this large sort of screen. And over on the left hand side, you can see all kinds of different templates that you can get started with. So I'm not going to show you exactly how to use Canva.com here. There's lots of different tutorials on YouTube or Udemy or wherever to learn Canva.com but here you can see that I can just go through some of these and there are some pretty cool templates to get started with. You do have to be a little bit careful about the text and where it's positioned, and sometimes that takes a little bit of time to get started. But but really quickly, even though I'm not really going to show you exactly what to do if you sign in to Canva and you just type in YouTube channel art. And click YouTube channel are here. And then pick a template. So I'm just going to pick one really quick. I'll rename this fill Abner and then I'll change this to learn how to YouTube. For example, we can change the background to like a color, so I'm just going to delete that. And for the background let's just pick something a little bit cool. So I like this blue color, something like that. Now I'm just going to download this really quick by clicking download and download. I'm going to do a JPEG download that file. And then once this downloads, we're going to upload it to our channel. So I'm just going to click Add Channel Art. Now this one has downloaded. So we'll call this channel Art. Put it on my desktop. Now I'm just going to upload that file. So whether you've created a file yourself in Photoshop or in Canva, you upload that file here. There is a max file size of six megabyte megabytes. Once it uploads, you do have a chance to kind of preview what it looks like. I know it's kind of hard to see. It's not the screen isn't that big, but you can kind of see what it's going to look like. You can adjust the crop, for example, maybe we want to crop in so that just this black part shows or I might have to go back and actually edit it so that this bar, this black bar is a little bit bigger unless you like how that looks. And then just click select and then it's added to your channel. And that's how you get started with customizing your channel Art. Let me know if you have any questions and I'll help you out. And we're we're going to move on to customizing your channel.

==== Channel Description & Links

In this lesson, we're going to learn about updating your channel description and a couple of other things you can do in your description or in your about section. Notice how now on my channel I updated the YouTube channel. Ah, just to get it sort of more on brand. If I was creating this channel about how to YouTube, I think that looks a little bit better. So here we're on our channel. It's pretty quick and easy to change your description. Just click the about tab and then click Add Channel Description. Basically what your description is is text that describes your channel and helps search engines find your YouTube channel. So it's important to include keywords about what your channel topics are. So if you teach about video production and photography, you'll want that included in your channel description. Because if someone's searching for that on YouTube, your channel can show up because not only do videos show up in the results, but also channels you want your most important information up at the top of your description. This is just general best practice for copywriting. You want what's most important to be at the top so people who get there are going to read that. First, make sure you add some action words to get people to subscribe or watch. So if there's particular types of videos or playlists or things like that, you could include information on that or just to remind people to subscribe because you're going to be posting weekly or daily or whatever it is. And then also on here, we're going to be able to add links to our own website, social media channels as well. So this is where you add that description. There is also other information here. You could add an email for your business. So this is cool because if you do have a business, then people are are able to follow up with you. And if, for example, you have a podcast or some sort of interview based video series, then someone might be able to reach out to you if they want to be on your podcast, including your location can also be important. And then also down here you have your links. So here you just have different links that you can add, such as your website, your social media. And the cool thing is that these links will then show up as an overlay right here. So for if we go to my personal channel, you can see that I have a free trial link, a link to my course pages, a link to my Facebook, a link to my Twitter. And really I should update this for my Instagram account. The one issue I have here is that it takes the fab icon, which is this icon here from my website, which is a green, which is kind of hard to see on my channel art background. So that's just something to keep in mind. So for example, I could say website and we'll just do my own website, fill up intercom, we could do Instagram, Instagram dot com slash. Phil Ebner So then we click done and now those show up as links here. So maybe you want to tie a title. This is something like Phil's website. Something like that done. And now the first link here shows up as Phil's website. And the second one, let's see if we refresh this, if this fixes that up. Let's make sure we have it written out properly. And I realized before you have to actually include a HTTP colon slash slash in front of these for these links to work. So if we click done. Now we scroll up, you can see that our websites show up here and then here they show up as little overlays on our channel art with the first one actually being written out. So that's your most important link. So if you have like a freebie that you're giving away like I do, or you're just trying to get someone to do anything, use it in that first link spot. So even if we go to our home page here, we have these links. All right, so now's your chance to do all this. Make sure you go over to your about page. Add a great description. Add your business email of possible your location and links to your favorite websites or places you want people to get in touch with you. Cheers and we'll see you in the next lesson.

=== Section 4: Uploading Your Videos

==== Recommended Export Settings for YouTube

* Since you are using DaVince Resolve, this is not relevant. Period.

Before we get too far into this course, let's talk a little bit about what kind of settings you should be using to import and export your videos as you create them. I'm here on the YouTube Help Support Page for the recommended upload and upload encoding settings that they recommend. And I'll quickly go through and describe these. Then we'll go into Adobe Premiere and actually show you how those look when you're exporting a video. So to start for the container they recommend an MP for and if you're filming on maybe a Canon camera or if you're working on a mac, occasionally you might find a container, which is the extension. If you have file one, MP four or file one, you might see MV regardless, you want the container and your export to be MP for for the video, for the audio, you want an RC codec and that should be in stereo or 5.1 surround. I'm sure most of your videos will just be in regular stereo audio for the video codec. This is important. You want it to be h264 and this is still what Google recommends as of February 2019. I am assuming they're going to start recommending h2h265 at some point. So reference this help page and see if they've updated that in the future. But for now, this is the codec that you want to use to compress the video. So the video codec is what takes the uncompressed video or less compressed video and makes it into a smaller, more manageable size for YouTube. The frame rate is just exactly that when you capture the video on your camera. If you're familiar with your camera settings, you have options like 24 PPI, 30 PPI, 60 PPI, super slow modes, 120 frames per second. We shoot all our videos in 24 frames per second. That's just a personal preference. You can shoot in 30 or 60 if you wish. But YouTube supports 24, 25, 25. If you're in the UK or Europe, 30, 48, 50 and 60. So the two most I'm sorry, the three most common are going to be 24, 30 and 60. If you're in the United States, 60 is going to have look a little smoother, but it's going to be less cinematic. 24 is going to be the most cinematic and then 30 is going to be some something like TV. Bitrate is the amount of data that each second of video has. And so you can just reference this chart here depending on if you're uploading in 4K or 1080 P, we personally still upload in 1080 P. I know most creators probably at this point upload in 4K. We just do not find it worth the trouble to upgrade all of our editing software. I'm sorry, our editing computer, our cameras cards need to be faster. The file sizes are harder to manage. Everything is much more difficult than 4K. And personally most we don't own any computers that can display 4K. Actually, that's not true. Our MacBooks can display 4K regardless. We watch videos in 1080 PPI at the very most, and so that is what we upload. They're recommended Bitrates are between eight and 12, depending on the frame rate. And then finally the resolution and aspect ratio resolution is whether it's 1080 PPI or 4K or 720 PPI. The aspect ratio is the shape of the video. And so most YouTube videos and most movies and pretty much every screen you see these days has a 16 by nine aspect ratio. The camera you're shooting on probably shoots in 16 by nine. So you would you don't really need to mess with this, but in case it is an option, you do not want four by three, you want 16 by nine. Although I have noticed that YouTube will support now alternate ratios. If you want something wider and more cinematic, the player will naturally adjust to that. So this is actually outdated, I believe. Let's head over to Premiere so I can show you exactly what this looks like and we'll bring up. I already had this open. Here is our project for this course. I have all of my sequences here across the top and we're just on our second video here, which is the choosing a title. So I'm in my sequence if I just go to file export and export media. Here we are with all the options for our export. If you're using Adobe Premier, they make this very simple. You don't need to worry about anything. Simply click the preset here on the preset button, scroll all the way down, and depending on if you're shooting in 4K or shooting in HD, simply click it and then you're done. Click export and it's ready to go. If you're not using Premiere or if you're using an older version, the settings are all the same. So let's quickly go through so the basic video settings here. This is the resolution 1920 by 1080. So that's the 1080 resolution that we're using. The frame rate we're using is 23.976. And the encoding. I want to get down to bitrate. So the YouTube preset on this has a target rate of 16. YouTube recommends 8 to 12, so that's just a little bit more. But it's not overkill. And then if we scroll over to that scroll, click on audio, you'll notice the default format is also AAC. So if your editing software gives you the option of MPEG or AAC. Remember, YouTube recommends RC. You can also make sure that the format is age to six for. If know YouTube starts recommending age to six five, that will be an option in the new versions of Premiere, I'm sure, and you can use that as well, but you want to make sure that you're using a compressed a compressed codec, for example, quick time if you're on a mac will probably be the default as a movie file. That's just too much or too big rather for YouTube to handle. So format h26 for preset youtube 1080 P Choose your resolution, choose your bitrate and then make sure your audio is set to RC again. If you have the preset, you don't need to worry about this at all. Click export. And there it goes. We'll see in the next one.

==== Choose a Title

Choosing a good title for your video is a critical part of growing an audience on YouTube. Not only does your title tell YouTube what the video is about, but it tells the person clicking your video what they should expect. A good title needs to be both accurate and eye catching. The word clickbait is often thrown around with a negative connotation. Generally, a video with a clickbait title doesn't deliver what the viewer expects. They're often generic and make unverifiable claims. I did blink and you won't believe what happened next. Try doing this one simple trick and the results will shock you. Clickbait of that kind should be avoided and it is not your goal. Although clickbait titles do often work, the clicks you receive will be very low quality. Viewers will quickly click away, and when they realize you aren't delivering some big secret, they won't subscribe or seek you out for new content. On the other hand, a catchy title is extremely important. You want to catch the eye and pique the interest of potential viewers. You can get away with building up expectations or in some cases even slightly exaggerating if your video delivers good content. With that in mind, let's outline a few practical tips for crafting a great video title.

*One*. Make it unique. A good video title should stand out in the search results. For example, easy DIY project is far too generic. It says nothing about what the project is or why the viewer should click on it instead of all the other ones in the search results. *Alternatively*, how to make a cutting board with no power tools tells the viewer exactly what to expect and why they should click on your video to focus on one or two main keywords. If you make a video about a product or a technique, you'll want to be sure to include that keyword in the beginning of your title. For example, is The Instant Pot Worth Buying? This title tells YouTube that your video should be included in the search results when someone types instant pot. But it also intrigues viewers, we naturally want to know the answer to the question is the instant pot worth buying? Similar, but slightly less engaging title might be why I love my instant pot. Although it's still an okay video title, it's given away the ending of the video before the viewer even clicks on it. They know you like it.

*Three*. Keep it short and sweet. Although you can expand your title length a bit by using a colon or a dash, keep the main component of your title short and to the point is college worth it? That would make a great title by itself. An example of the same title that might be a little too long would be a tour of my college and why I think it's worth the money. If you wanted to expand our short and sweet title, you might add a colon and say, Is college worth it? Thoughts from a recent graduate or make it even more engaging? Is college worth it? $114,000 in debt and I'm scared much more click baity, but it's also more relatable *Four* Make It About the viewer. Speaking of making things relatable, you might have noticed there's a theme in our example so far. *The bad titles are mostly about ourselves, and the good ones are about the viewer*. Is the instant pot worth it? Makes the viewer ask the question themselves. Why I love my instant pot makes it all about you. A tour of my college is all about you and your college experience. Is college worth it? Directs that attention back to the viewer. In both cases, the content is identical. But if you can put the viewer in your shoes, they're much more likely to stick around and see how the video ends. You shouldn't feel the need to cover everything that happens in your video. In its title, the title is just the introduction to what the video will be about. The video description is where you can expand on what the video is about and why they should keep watching, which is exactly what we'll cover in the next video.

==== Write Your Description

* Actionable

If the video title is there to engage the viewer, then the video description is there to inform them. Something you have to keep in mind when making YouTube videos is that the majority of your viewers are completely unfamiliar with you or your work. *You want to make sure there's some kind of context or background available so that they can get caught up to speed if they want to. Similar to the video title, the video description serves to inform both the viewer of the video and the YouTube search and suggestion algorithm what your video is about*.

Here are #*some tips to maximize the impact of your description*#. Be sure to include your main one or two keywords or topics covered in the first two sentences of your description. Not only are the first few words heavily weighted by the YouTube search engine, but they're also often the only thing a potential viewer will see when they search for a video below. Each video title you can see there is the name of your channel, how old the video is, how many views it has, and then two lines of your video description. The first two lines use this to your advantage. Don't write in a robotic language. Use sentences that make sense to a reader. YouTube can see through a stream or block of keywords and will disregard them in the algorithm. Right for humans, not for computers too.

#*Don't duplicate your title in the description*# between the title and the video description preview. On the search page that we just talked about, you have a total of three lines to convince a potential viewer to click on your video. Duplicating your title. Word for word in the description would just be a waste of space. Include the same keywords as we discussed, but find new ways to describe your video. Example with our title is The Instant Pot Worth It? We might make a description that says, I put my new instant pot to the test. Can you really cook food faster that tastes better with this $50 kitchen gadget? As you can see, we use the same keywords as our title, but we expanded it and made it more interesting for the viewer to read. After your initial two line teaser in the description. *Be sure to include a biography about yourself*. This has been recommended to us over and over by our YouTube manager, and it makes perfect sense. Viewers want to get a little bit of background information on you so they can decide whether or not to trust your judgment. For example, below your description that we just wrote, you could say I'm a stay at home mom. With six years of professional culinary experience on my channel, you'll find cooking tips, tricks, reviews, and the latest kitchen gadgets. Now that you've described yourself to the viewer, they might relate and trust your opinion on the instant pot more than someone else on YouTube for include a call to action. Every video you produce should have some kind of call to action. At the end of it, you might direct viewers to a book you wrote or a T-shirt you sell or an Amazon link to a product you just reviewed. *At the very least, you should include links to your other social media platforms and an invitation to subscribe to your channel*. If you mentioned any links to other YouTube videos or websites, the description is the place to put them. *Five*. Use hashtags. If you use hashtags in the description of your video, for example, meal prep, sun or cooking or Mike and Lauren, your viewers can click on those links and they will be brought to a page of videos that share the same hashtag. Not only can you use this method to increase watch time on your own channel, but even if viewers watch someone else's video and stay on YouTube, you'll be rewarded for that effort by YouTube. A little bit more on that later.

==== Add SEO-Friendly Tags

As we discussed previously, stuffing your title or your description with a long stream of keywords is not only unlikely to help your video perform better, but it's against YouTube's community guidelines. Instead, the best place to put all of the key words and phrases related to your video content is in the tag section. *Tags are just another form of metadata that YouTube uses to better understand what your video is about and who it should suggest it to*. Like your title and description tag should be both accurate and relevant. *Using tags that don't accurately represent the content of your video will not help you because when your video doesn't deliver what it promised to a viewer, your watch time will decrease. And then YouTube will stop recommending that video to new viewers*. So it actually hurts you. So that's the purpose of tags, but how many should you use and how can you best optimize them for YouTube search? While YouTube has no official recommendation on the number of tags it's looking for in any of its online documentation. But during our YouTube partner consultations, our manager at Google always said as many as are needed to describe your video, which is pretty vague. *So when I pressed her a little further, she said anywhere between six and 12 tags is suggested*. All that to say, I don't have a strong feeling that YouTube really cares about perfectly optimized tags, and I don't think it will actually make or break a video, but that doesn't mean they should be ignored. Here's a few tips we've learned over the years to quickly generate a list of optimized tags, *focus on both keywords and key phrases. The tag field is not limited to just single keywords. You can use sentences and short alternate titles*. Anything that will help YouTube understand your video better should go in the tag section. Don't worry about punctuation, capitalization or preposition tags are for YouTube only. They're not for users, and you only have 500 characters. So if you use phrases, eliminate words like the A at on cross reference. Other videos that have similar content. So if you mention a previous video in your video that you're posting, be sure to include similar tags from both videos so that YouTube knows that the new video is related to the old video. Does that make sense? Provide context. Tags are a great place to tell YouTube who is in the video, what they're doing, and why they're doing it and when it's happening, if that's relevant to the video. For example, let's look at our Is College Worth It video as an example. A tag section for that video might look like this. Mike and Lauren. Is college worth it? University student loans debt. Florida State University Advice College versus trades vocation. As you can see, we make sure to include who is in the video, what topic was discussed and why. There might be doubt and a little bit of context like our alma mater, Florida State University. If you want help creating tags, there are plenty of online keyword generators and metadata scrapers that you can use to improve your tag optimization. But personally, I don't think tags influence YouTube's decisions enough to spend that much time or in some cases quite a bit of money purchasing those tools. Write tags as if you were describing the video to a friend, and I think you'll do just fine.

==== Create a Clickable Thumbnail

It would be difficult for me to decide if I think a well-written title or a well-designed thumbnail is more important when creating a YouTube video. *On the one hand, the title of the video is what will actually capture a viewer and get them to click on a video. On the other hand, a thumbnail that stands out in the search results will be what gets the viewer to read your title in the first place*. In any case, you should take creating thumbnails and titles for your videos very seriously. While YouTube is getting better and better at recommending screen capture moments in your video and auto generating pretty good thumbnails. *I still think it's worth putting a little extra effort into it. In fact, according to YouTube, 90% of the best performing videos on YouTube have custom thumbnails*. Now I'm not exactly sure what they consider best performing, but these are their words, not mine. You'll want to include at least a little text and possibly use some photo editing software to highlight important parts so that viewers will notice. We personally use Photoshop as part of our creative cloud suite to edit our thumbnails, but there are plenty of free options like -- or Photoshop online. Alternatively, there are a ton of apps out there for your phone or tablet that are more than powerful enough to put text on a thumbnail and uploaded to YouTube. Teaching you graphic design from the ground up is way beyond the scope of this course. However, there are plenty of free tutorials online, or Phil has a Photoshop course that I can highly recommend that will take you from start to finish once you feel comfortable navigating the photo editing software of your choice. Here are just a *few tips to help you optimize your thumbnails for YouTube*. *One* Include yourself in your thumbnails. If there's one thing our YouTube manager made abundantly clear in all of our consultations, it's that thumbnails with people outperform those with only graphics. In the early days of our YouTube career, we would design a completely original thumbnail for each and every one of our videos with vector art. As it turns out, that's not the best way to attract attention from new viewers. Include yourself and ideally the subject of your video in the thumbnail. In the case of our instant pot review, a simple counter up shot with the appliance and your face would be ideal for our is college worth it video? Maybe just a selfie in front of your school would do the trick. Overlay a shortened version of your title on your thumbnail. *Ideally, only use three words or less*. Remember that most people are viewing your video on mobile devices and it's entirely possible that your entire thumbnail that you put all this time into takes up less than an inch of real estate on their screen. *The thumbnails that catch my eye the most use high contrast big bold lettering*. For our woodworking project, you might overlay the words No Power Tools or my first project or easy cutting board. If I personally saw bold letters in a thumbnail saying No power tools, my interest would be piqued enough to at least read the title, which would tell me exactly what to expect in the video. Avoid clickbait thumbnails. Although a thumbnail with a half dressed woman in a bikini might get you more initial clicks when the video doesn't include that imagery as it would be against of YouTube's terms of service anyway. You'll lose watch time and the video will stop being suggested because people are clicking away. As you'll learn later in the Grow Your Channel section, #*subscribers don't really matter. Views don't really matter. Watch. Time is what YouTube values the most*#. Not to mention if you want to make money on YouTube, your thumbnails, titles and content should all be advertiser friendly in YouTube's words, meaning they don't use sexual imagery, profanity, violence or drugs. Use high resolution images. YouTube recommends that your thumbnails be at least 1280 by 720 pixels, but we personally always just set up our Photoshop for 1920 by 1080, and that has always worked well across all devices. Once your photo editing skills improve a little bit, try to include some depth in your thumbnail. Good thumbnail will have a foreground, a middle ground, and a background. In our case, most of our backgrounds are captures from the video itself, and then the middle ground is the text, and then the foreground is the subject. So if we took our instant pot review example, the background would be the kitchen, the middle ground would be our text that said instant pot review, and then the foreground would be the instant pot itself and our face so that the viewer knows exactly who and what the video is about.

==== Engage with Cards and End Screens

Maybe you've been watching a YouTube video before and a little grey eye pops up in the corner of the screen and the title of a suggestive video slides out. *That's called a card on YouTube*, and you should be using them to suggest new content to your viewers. But cards don't just have to be used to recommend your own videos. You can also recommend someone else's YouTube videos. You can link to other websites that you own. You can link to approved merchandise outlet. You can have poles. You can have crowdfunding platforms. It's a very versatile tool. In most cases, cards and end screens give viewers quick and easy links to recommended videos where, unlike the featured page or the YouTube suggested videos in the sidebar, you control the videos that are suggested to your viewers that you think they're going to want to watch next. *And screens are like cards, but they're only available to overlay in the last 5 to 20 seconds of your video and you can promote up to four elements*. Those elements can include a subscribe button. Links to other videos, crowdfunding platforms or playlists. There's no reason not to use end screens and cards to your advantage, even if you don't specifically mention another video of yours in your new video. Selecting other videos that might be of interest to your viewers will help provide context. If you're vlogging, you could provide links to the previous and next episode. If you're filming a series, you could include a link to the playlist of all the videos in that series, or, if nothing else, at least offer new viewers an easy way to subscribe for more videos when crafting and screen and card teasers. Here's just a couple of tips. Unless you want your viewer to leave in the middle of your video for context, place your cards promoting merchandise and crowdfunding at the end of your video. The best place to put video recommendations is just as you're wrapping up and you want your viewer to seamlessly click from one video to the next so that you increase your overall watch time. Don't spam your audience even properly. Used cards can be a huge distraction to viewers, and in my opinion, you should limit the number of cards in your video to two or three max link to videos you know have performed well in the past. *If you don't have a specific video that you want to recommend in your cards or end screen link to one of your best performing videos as a default*. If a new viewer finds your channel for the first time and they want to see more, don't send them off to see a video that doesn't put your best foot forward. *Use your analytics to find your most popular videos with the most watched time and link to those. Monitor your analytics to see which cards are performing the best*. When we get to the analytics section, we'll dive a little bit deeper into cards, but know that YouTube allows you to see exactly how many clicks your cards and your end to end screens receive. Monitor that page regularly to improve your teasers and suggested videos and make better use out of your cards and end screens.
