== Become a SuperLearner 2: Learn Speed Reading & Boost Memory - Jonathan Levi

=== Section 1: Introduction and Setting Yourself Up For Success

*About Us: How This Course Came To Be*

Hi, my name is Jonathan Levi, and I'm going to be the instructor of this course, "Become a SuperLearner". Perhaps you're just joining us, and this is the first time you've ever been exposed to super learning. Perhaps you're one of the over 50,000 students and readers of our version 1.0 course. *Either way, you're here because you wanna learn faster, remember more, and unlock the vast potential of your mind*. Well you're in great hands, because this course will help you do all of that. It requires no prior knowledge, and it's perfect for beginners all the way up to folks looking for a review, or even people seeking more advanced techniques. It's also jam-packed with new materials, thorough demonstrations, and hands-on worksheets, making it our most effective and comprehensive course to date. Now, I'm sure you're quite eager to start deconstructing the learning process, hacking your memory and upgrading your reading speed. Honestly, we're excited to take this journey with you, too. But, before we can get started, I'd like to give you a quick story of how this course originally came to be, and what we've accomplished since its inception.

So, about two years ago, after selling my e-commerce company, I was interning in a venture capital firm with some very smart people. And I came to know someone named *Lev*, who was working in one of the startups there in the VC. I realised that Lev was a little bit different when we began sharing common interests. When I would send Lev an article I found interesting, I'd get a reply back in about a minute or two with half a page of comments. Lev also had a habit of sending me five to 10 news articles every morning as *he* sat there and drank his coffee. These often were about a minute or two apart, and they all came in the span of under half an hour. Now, eventually, I started to wonder what was up. And so, I went into Lev's office, and I saw him scrolling rapidly down the page. So I said, "Lev, if you're not going "to actually read the articles, "you can't rightfully send them for me to read." Lev told me that, actually, he did read the articles. And when I pressed for details or information about some of them, I saw that, in fact, his comprehension of the articles was extraordinarily high. Now immediately, I thought, "Oh, you read it before "I sent it to you, my mistake." *He told me that, no, actually, the speed in which he was scrolling down the page was actually the speed of him reading*. I was shocked. I was sure that he was playing tricks on me. I mean, how do you have that level of detail and clarity when you're scrolling on the page as fast as I would scroll if I were searching for something? It was then that Lev told me that his wife is actually one of the leading specialists here in Israel on speed reading and mnemonics, or the study of memory techniques. Now, I'd done some work on speed reading myself, and I'd never actually succeeded. *I tried Tim Ferriss' PX method, I tried that Evelyn Wood book, 7-Day Speed Reading*. When Lev checked though, my speed was actually at about 450 words a minute, but with about 20% comprehension. Lev, on the other hand, was comfortably reading at about 1500 words a minute with 80 to 90% comprehension. Needless to say, I immediately inquired as to how I could learn this amazing skill, and fortunately for me, *Anna* offered private coaching sessions. Now, they weren't cheap, and the whole process took about six weeks. But, and *I have to say this with no exaggeration, that course changed my life. When I went off to a condensed one year MBA, those skills saved me so much time and allowed me to keep up with the near-superhuman workload assigned by my professors*. I found myself, during group exams or group work, reading the pages and then looking up to see that everyone else would take another 10 to 15 minutes to read the exact same content. There were a lot of funny times during business school where people would say, "You know, we'd really appreciate "if you would actually read the article." And I'd say, "Yeah, I read the article. "In fact, check out page 32, exhibit C, "you'll find the exact information we're looking for." Since the moment I acquired this amazing skill, people have had a lot of questions. *The biggest one is, can anyone do this? And the answer is yes, you can do this, but only with the proper instruction*, and, in my opinion, only with the unique methods developed by Anna and Lev. Now, for this reason, at first, I referred three or four of my friends to Anna to take private coaching lessons via Skype. But, Anna's only one woman, and as I said, the course isn't cheap, and she's had to raise her rates over the years because she simply doesn't have enough hours in the day to coach everyone. Now, after my MBA, I was taking some other courses on Udemy, and I thought it would be a great platform to share the information and really spread the potential of these skills. So I translated the materials from Hebrew, and I added in some of the articles and research that I'd found helpful as a student, and I created a course out of it. I also used my super learning skills to read everything I could find about online courses and marketplaces, pedagogical design, and so much more. Still, when we uploaded the original course, we could've never imagined what would happen next. Within two years, we'd accumulated about 50,000 students. We'd appeared on numerous top-ranking podcasts, we'd published a bestselling book, we'd even ranked among the top instructors in the history of Udemy. And that brings us to where we are today, SuperLearner 2.0. Over the years, since publishing the course, we've learned a lot. We've had tens of thousands of students go through the course, and so we know where students struggle. We know which topics need a little more clarification. We even have some great new content, like worksheets, and quizzes, and demonstrations. All in all, this course is the product of hundreds of thousands of hours of real-world testing, and we believe it's the absolute best accelerated learning and speed reading programme on the face of the planet. Throughout the course, we're going to help you completely deconstruct your learning process starting with hacking your memory. *We're going to teach you a new way to create and store memories, how to triple your reading speed, and we're going to give you the tools to do rigorous at-home training. It's not going to be easy. Becoming a super learner is about much, much more than some of the traditional speed reading programmes out there. It's a comprehensive shift in the way that you learn. This means that we're going to have to retool the way you learn and remember new information first and foremost. What I'm trying to say is this. You're going to have to work for this, and it's not going to happen overnight. But, with the lectures and the worksheets and exercises we've provided, you can and you will succeed*. If you're eager, and you have the free time now, it's a great idea to go through all of the video lectures and prepare yourself for what you're about to learn. But, if you're pressed for time, you can also go through the lectures one-by-one, stopping to do the homework of that week at each stage. And with that, we'll go ahead and dive right in, and start setting up to succeed in this course.

*Downloading The Course Resources & How To Succeed*

We know you’re excited to begin the course - so we won’t make this a long lecture. We just want to make sure that you know about the most powerful resource and companion you’ll have in your journey to becoming a superlearner - *the PDF syllabus. In this all-in-one document, you’ll find a week-by-week guide explaining your weekly goals and expected milestones, as well as convenient and easy-to-use links to each and every one of the resources, games, worksheets, and supplemental materials*. What, you didn’t think there would be homework? of course there is. After all, Learning is NOT a Spectator Sport! One of the many things you’re going to soon understand about learning is that it absolutely MUST be hands-on. If it’s not in your hands, it’s not in your head. This means that sitting here and listening to my explanation is really only 20% of this course. The rest of the time, you’ll be doing worksheets, practicing reading and memory skills, playing fun games, watching inspiring videos from famous SuperLearners, and chatting with your peers in the lively SuperLearner Facebook community. Don’t worry, it’s going to be a lot of fun. In addition to the PDF Syllabus, you can optionally download a nice HTML Bookmarks file, which you can easily import into any browser such as Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and even Internet Explorer or Microsoft Edge Since you’ll be referring to these links and games nearly every single day for the next couple of months, we suggest saving them somewhere where they’re easy to find. *You’ll notice that we ask you to #set aside five to six sessions of about 40 minutes in length every week#. Sure, you can commit less time and still dramatically improve your skills, but this is the amount that we recommend for students who really want to succeed - and that includes you - doesn’t it?* Anyways, a lot of that time is going to be spent reading - which you probably already do for work or for school - and playing games. So, if you just sub out some of the other games you're already playing, you won’t even notice the time going by. On the other hand, there IS such a thing as working too hard, and we HAVE seen students over-do it, *and so we want you to limit your practice and studying to no more than 8 hours per week, to prevent fatigue, burnout, and frustration, and also to allow your brain the necessary time to adapt and build the new connections and habits we’re going to be studying*. Maybe 8 hours doesn’t seem like a lot. Maybe it seems like a TON of time. Either way, you might be wondering what we’re going to do with all of this time. That’s a great question. But instead of spending more time in this lecture telling you what we’re going to do week-by-week, I’m going to leave it up to you to check out the PDF syllabus. It will explain what each week looks like, and why. Make sure to check out those nice little italic notes in the beginning and end of each week for some guidance.

*Progressive Overload & What To Do If You Get Frustrate*

In this course, you're going to be relearning how to learn. Now, I'm sure you already know how to learn or you wouldn't be where you are today. But to be honest, a lot of the things you know about learning and reading and memory, well, they've got to go. This can be really frustrating. After all, these are habits you've probably had for decades. At first, it's going to feel a lot like learning to walk on your hands. *Throughout the course, we're going to be using a training methodology called progressive overload, progressive overload is a fundamental principle at the core of all strength and fitness training, and it's applicable to your mental skills as well. The basic idea is to always be training near or just below your limits. You always lift weights that are relatively heavy or run at a pace that is relatively challenging, by doing this, you avoid the injury and the damage and the frustration that could result in training beyond your limits. But you also avoid getting stuck in a rut by not pushing yourself enough. Most importantly, every time you progress, you immediately increase the level of intensity to maintain your progress*. There are a few fundamental principles that make progressive overload work, such as periodization or rest periods and variations in intensity and volume of training, but you can leave all of that up to us. What you need to know is that you're going to be training near or at your level of comfort, and that's by design. Your job as a student is simply to be aware of your current level, to make sure that you're not training above or below it, and to vary the intensity, to suit your needs and your progress on our end. We'll give you the tools and metrics to diagnose if your training is right in that sweet spot. Now, I don't want to sugarcoat it. *The truth is that some frustration and struggle is unavoidable, but this actually works in our favor. As my friend Peter S. Brown, author of the book Make It Stick, The Science of Successful Learning, says when learning comes easily, it doesn't stick*. Sure, these methods are going to make it easier and more fun than ever before to learn new information, but that doesn't mean that it's going to be effortless. We want you to work hard in this course, but we don't want you to be frustrated or to feel beat down. So here are a few things we're going to do together to prevent that frustration.



The first thing you're going to do is to complete the goals and progress worksheet and posted publicly near your desk, we want you to identify the three to five goals you have for this course, as well as the reasons you want to accomplish those goals. But be specific, a goal like read faster, it doesn't tell you much, but a goal like read seven hundred words per minute with 80 percent retention by November of this year. That's right. On the money. These goals are a key aspect of your motivation. And as you're going to learn when we discuss adult andrology theory and educational psychology, that's a big part of the accelerated learning process by itself.

The next thing we want you to do to avoid frustration is to check out the articles in the PDF syllabus. One is about something called the *Pomodoro technique*, which is a method used to prevent fatigue and frustration. Basically, you'll train for twenty to twenty five minutes and then take a five minute break and then train for another twenty to twenty five minutes and then take another five minute break after four pomodoro or twenty to twenty five minute periods, you'll take a longer break, a 15 to 30 minutes. This method has been proven to be one of the most effective ways to maintain focus and creativity. So check it out.

There's also an article by Dr. Lev on how to avoid headaches and mental fatigue, which is definitely worth checking out.

Next up, we've included a bunch of lectures and interviews with some world class super learners from all over the world, from people like Tim Ferriss to memory champions and hyper polyglots. What makes these lectures great for eliminating frustration is that each of these super learners will openly admit that they're not a particular genius and that you can learn to do what they do easily. Any time you feel frustrated, check out one of these supplementary materials and you'll be completely inspired. *They'll also remind you that you can do this with a little hard work and the proper techniques.*

Lastly, we just want to remind you that the super Lerner community is here to help, if you have a question or feel frustrated or get stuck, you always are encouraged to post in the course *Facebook group* where thousands of super learners from all over the world, including myself and Dr. Love, are happy to help you along.

OK, enough with all the introductions and formalities. Right. Let's dive in already. First, make sure to check the PDF syllabus for this lectures homework, because you already have some important assignments and recommended materials to start working on. Once you've done that, the next lecture is going to be a diagnostic worksheet which you'll use to measure your baseline reading speed and comprehension level. Get ready, guys. It's going to be a super fun ride. OK, everyone, before we move on to the next section, I just want to let you know that pretty soon Udemy is going to ask you if you would like to leave a review and if you could just take a quick second and go ahead and leave us a review. We would really appreciate it because it boosts our credibility, helps us bring in more students, which helps us build even better courses. And by the way, if you've had anything less than an absolutely perfect experience, then just go ahead and send us a message and we'll actually go ahead and improve that part of the course for you anyway. We really, really appreciate it. And let's move on.

=== Section 2: Understanding Your Memory (So You Can Improve it!)

*Why We Need To Improve Our Memory First*

Great, so you've set a baseline reading speed and comprehension, and you've completed the misconceptions worksheet to pique your curiosity and prime your mind for what you're about to learn. Soon, you'll understand why these steps were so important. So, let's dive in and start by improving our memory. To understand why memory improvement should be done before speed reading, I want you to imagine a bucket. Above that bucket, you have a funnel and pointing into the funnel right now is your regular, average garden hose. It's no problem, right? Now, imagine we switch out that garden hose for a fire hose. Big problem. The funnel is immediately overwhelmed and it's probably blown to smithereens. Water starts spilling everywhere and in about a nanosecond the bucket overflows too, and it's not long before you have to shut the water off completely.

*If we take this metaphor for our learning process, it's easy to understand why we have to first upgrade the bucket and then the funnel before we finally upgrade the hose. #You see, the hose itself represents your input speed or your reading speed, whereas the funnel represents the combination of two different types of memory, your working memory and your short term memory#. You may have heard the term #working memory# before, since people often incorrectly use it as interchangeable with #short term memory#. It's best to explain the difference clearly though. Working memory is the type of very short term memory that allows you to remember what I said at the beginning of this sentence so that you could connect it all together and understand the complete idea and then analyse it at the end of the sentence*.

*Like the name suggests, working memory is really for working with and understanding new information in real-time. It's actually a lot less about memory than about understanding and analysis. One last point on working memory. Our brains do use several different types of buffers to work with the various types of information. This basically means that words, ideas, images, and scenes, they don't all use the same path to get to the short term memory*, but we'll get to all that and why it's important a little bit later.

So, what is that short term memory then? *Well, once you've used your working memory to process, understand, and interact with a piece of information, your short term memory is what keeps it in your mind for about 15 to 20 seconds. This might seem like a really short amount of time, and it is, that's why for the majority of the course, we're going to focus on improving the connexion all the way from your working memory to your long term memory. This is because if you do a good enough job creating those short term memories that'll stick till you get to the end of a page or an article, you'll only need to use some simple review techniques and regular maintenance to keep things in your long term memory, where we eventually want all our new information to remain.*

*This means that right now, our working and short term memory are the primary bottlenecks. Without the right infrastructure and base skillset to improve these two types of memory, speed reading is pretty useless, even impossible*. This is why I personally failed twice before reaching Anna's course. It's also why a lot of people think that speed reading is a myth. Because most speed reading courses wanna get you in and out as quickly as possible, and to do that all that's necessary is go give you the illusion that you're reading faster. If you've ever played around with some of those speed reading applications like Spritz or tried out the method in Tim Ferriss' popular article Scientific Speed Reading: How to Read 300% Faster in 20 Minutes, you'll know that reading faster is not that big of a challenge, until you realise that you likely comprehend nothing. Even Ferriss himself is unable to offer any advice for this besides urging people not to be too concerned with comprehension or retention. It'll somehow magically catch up. *But comprehension and retention or actually understanding and remembering what you read are the major challenges to speed reading that most people fail to overcome*. Don't believe me? No problem. Let's read an article together at my average speed.

As you can see, reading this quickly is actually not nearly as challenging as you might think. Like Tim Ferriss, I could teach you to do it in 10 to 20 minutes. Storing memories at this speed, however, is a totally different challenge. How many of you comprehended what you were reading? How many of you actually remember it? And better yet, how many of you will remember it one hour from now? *To put it bluntly, this is why we need to upgrade your memory first and foremost. Unfortunately, academic institutions don't teach sophisticated memory or learning techniques. We're expected to just remember things without ever being taught the proper skills to store a large number of effective, high-quality memories fast.* This means that most of us, when we have to learn new information, are subjected to rote memorization or very basic pneumonic devices. If you remember the phrase I before E except after C, or you ever use the mathematical pneumonic PEMDAS, you know exactly what I'm talking about. These methods are hugely effective for children learning simple things like mathematical conventions, but they don't allow us much flexibility with the information, and we become highly dependent on them. For example, how many of you can tell me what the eleventh letter of the English alphabet is? Honestly, even I can't do it because I learned that using a song. So I only know that information chronologically and like most of you, I have to sing through the song in my head to arrive at the answer. By the way, it's K. Furthermore, what if you had to memorise much more complex information, such as the chronological order of historical events, or all the ligaments in the human body? For that, you need an entirely new set of memorization skills. Ones that give you a richer understanding of the material way beyond songs or acronyms. Fortunately, this is not boring stuff at all. The is a general theory on how to improve learning, not just for reading, but also for meeting new people, learning new skills and so much more. While we work our way through the course, you'll be able to apply these skills in your daily life, and that will keep you engaged, motivated, and thirsty for the next set of skills. And that by itself is a hugely important aspect of accelerated learning. If you don't use it, you literally lose it. And as we'll learn, it's very hard to learn new things unless we're able to generate some interest and passion around them.

*How We Store Information: A Very Brief Explanation*

Personally I believe that it's easier to use a technique if you understand how it works. This is why whenever I teach someone to drive a manual car, I always make sure that they understand what's happening when you move the gear shift and what the clutch actually does. And so while I'm certainly not a cognitive scientist, I want to give you a very basic explanation of how your memory works. This is important because it'll help you understand why we do some of the strange things that we're going to do throughout this course. It's all linked to the actual inner workings of your mind and it's all based on neuroscientific research.

*So first and foremost, let me say that your mind is made up of about 100 billion tiny little cells called neurons. These are basically electrically excitable cells that process and transmit information using electrochemical signals. These signals are a lot like the electrical signals firing between different parts of your computer except in your brain there are no wires. Instead, we have synapses, and those are specialised connexions between the neurons*. I don't want to get too technical here because this is stuff is definitely over my head, and in fact the way our memory works is not yet fully understood even by leading cognitive scientists. *But basically memories are created when your brain sends neurotransmitter signals to two neurons at the same time. This strengthens the connexion between those two neurons and presto, you have a new memory. This is an important point to make because it shows that the creation of memories requires connexion between two neurons or a connexion to existing neurons in your brain. The other thing you need to know is that when this happens over and over again the cluster of neurons and their synaptic connexions become something called a neural network. From artificial intelligence research we know that neurons work better in these types of clusters. This means that when several neurons fire together the signal is actually amplified. That's why it's so crucial to store memories in several connected neurons and to further connect them to the memories that we often use*.

Now this is where it gets really important. Your brain has these two incredibly powerful parts called hippocampi, interestingly named for the fact that they look like little sea horses. You have one hippocampus for each hemisphere that, among other things, regulates how memories are created. As far as we're concerned, the most important function of these hippocampi is to determine what's worth remembering. There are a lot of criteria here including novelty, but perhaps one of the most important criteria for the hippocampi is to determine that something is relevant based on existing memories in our brains. *The net effect of this as we hinted before is that the more connexions there are to a piece of information, the more likely your hippocampi are to determine that it's worth storing.* But what about forgetting things over time? Well, our brains have a capacity of about 2.5 petabytes. That's plenty of room for all the things we want to super learn, so why does it seem like we're constantly forgetting things? As researchers have recently found, our brains actively forget memories in order to remain efficient and healthy. *Our brains know they're only two percent of our body mass, take up 20% of our energy consumption, so keeping them efficient is a huge evolutionary advantage for our bodies*. In fact, forgetting irrelevant information is so important that there are numerous mechanisms in the brain used to forget things based on whether it determines it should be forgotten because of trauma or just because it's not useful. In some of these processes the hippocampi are at play again and they're always searching for relevance and applicability. At the end of the day, this means that having many connexions to our memories has another massive benefit. It makes it less likely for them to be removed or to fade away. To give you a metaphor of this, I want you to imagine two roads, one is a six lane highway connecting eight medium-sized towns and another one is a country road connected one house to another. Now imagine that the state budget only has room to repair and maintain some of these roads, not all of them. Which road is more likely to receive regular maintenance and improvements? Which is more likely to be neglected and erode away? This for example is why you rarely forget information like your childhood address even if you haven't used it for years and years. Because there are so many connexions and stories and experiences around that piece of information your brain determines that it's critical and will never erode it away. Knowing this can benefit us tremendously. *The process of super learning necessitates that we create more connexions to the information we want to learn*. This way the mind is forced to remember it like we would remember everyday information that we use. Think about how children learn. For example, they pick up a spoon and they play with it time and time again. They eat with it, they drop it on the floor, all the while they're building connexions and an understanding and a history around that spoon, what it does and how it feels. Finally they learn to remember a sound, a name for it, spoon. This is also why writing things down or any type of pneumonic, even the basic ones, is a useful tactic for learning. You see, you're simply creating new memories in the form of stories or sentences and tying new information like the order of operations First, outer, inner, last in mathematics, to a word that you already know, FOIL. But what about in the adult brain? Of course, there are different requirements for adults to learn than for children, right? Well first and foremost I want to dispel the myth that children's brains are somehow better at absorbing new information or that they have a higher neuroplasticity.

*Recent studies have actually shown that this is simply not true. The reason that children seem to learn with more ease is that they're learning literally every waking hour and all information is new and exciting information for them. Furthermore, research shows that our brains do play by the use it or lose it rule. Most adults lose the ability to learn rapidly simply because they settle into their day-job and they stop learning in the volume that they used to as children, not because their brain chemistry or neuroplasticity have actually changed*. With that said, there are definitely some requirements that are unique to adult learners. In fact, in the 1950s one of the leading researchers in adult education, Malcolm Knowles published a book around the five requirements for adult learning. Now that we understand how the brain works a little bit, I don't think any of them will surprise you. T

here are *number one*: self-concept. Adults are self-directed and independent. They need to take an active role in creating their learning experience.

*Number two*: the role of experience. Adults have a growing reservoir of experience including mistakes that is a critical resource for their learning.

*Number three*: readiness to learn. Adults are most ready to learn things that are pertinent to their daily life situations.

*Number four*: orientation to learning. Adults respond best to learning that will be immediately applicable. Adults are more problem-centered than subject-centered in their learning.

*Number five*: motivation to learn. For adults, the motivation to learn is internal. This means that they must know why they need to learn this new information. So do you understand why we've done some of the things we've done in the last few lectures? Explaining why you need to know things, making you set your own goals and schedule your own learning sessions. In general you can leave it up to us as your instructors to make sure that this course follows along with all five requirements for adult andragogy as well as to conform to the formula that best suits your very picky hippocampi. But as we said before we can go far beyond this, beyond just setting up the materials in a way that's interesting to you and your brain. We can actually build synaptic connexions and memories in a much more efficient and rich way. And that is what we're gonna be learning in the next lectures, but first make sure to check out the PDF syllabus because there's a good amount of homework and a tonne of optional reading materials on everything we've learned in this lecture.


*The Importance Of Combining Games With Real Life Application*

I hope you are excited, because things are about to start ramping up. In the coming weeks, you are going to start doing exercises, playing games, and training your memory and reading skills in new and innovative ways. But before you do that, I want to give you a quick heads up. A lot of times, because the games are one of the only clearly specified and tangible action items we can assign, students can get hung up on those games and exercises, and that can stall their progress. Sure, it is very important that you actually do the exercises we recommend. And in a perfect world, we would want to see that you are reaching those skill levels that we outline in *the PDF syllabus or in the daily training log*. But, in doing that, I don't want you to lose sight of the big picture. Let's go back to the first action that you took in this course: the personal goals and progress worksheet. You set out a number of reasons and goals for taking this course, and it's probably safe to say that getting better at online games wasn't one of them. What I'm saying is this: I want you, guys, to remember that these games, worksheets, and exercises are intended as a means to an end. They are the best way that I, without taking each one of you and talking to you individually, and understanding your goals, can ensure that you are practising the skills regularly and in a somewhat controlled environment, but they are in no way a replacement for taking the skills out into the real world and practising them with real learning and memory challenges. In fact, if I really had to choose, I would much rather see you not quite meeting the prescribed goals in the PDF syllabus, but far exceeding your personal memory and learning goals. Because, let's face it, that's what's going to make your time and effort in this course really pay off. Memorising 20 random words is a great exercise, but it can't compare to tackling your actual homework and using markers to memorise it. Worksheets on creating markers are very useful too, but they can't compare to memorising the names of 10 new people a day. Identifying how many symbols flash on a page is a powerful way to train your eye, but it can't compare to actually speed-reading new information every day. *To sum it up: Do the exercises, but please, make time every day to apply these techniques to something besides the games in the upcoming sections. Really, because until you actually try to use these techniques for the areas of life that you need them the most, you simply won't figure out how to best adapt, apply, and enhance them to meet your specific goals. So, as you go along throughout the rest of the course, I want you to remember that the games are important, but that the real test of your super-learner skills is whether or not you can memorise everyday information, speed-read your daily reading assignments, and learn actual skills faster.*

*Chunking: Navigating The Brain’s Natural Limitations*

Soon we're going to learn how to "trick" the *hippocampi* into viewing things we want to learn as novel, exciting, relevant, and totally worth storing in our short term and longterm memory. However, before we get there, we need to focus on the working memory, that funnel that we were talking about earlier. This is pretty exciting because we can actually start to see some huge gains to our memory capacity very quickly by understanding how to take advantage of our working memory properly. Have you ever wondered why in every country in the world phone numbers are broken up into three to four digit clusters? Or why your credit card number has those spaces between the numbers? *This phenomena is intentional and it's because of a powerful little brain hack called chunking*. You see, for most people, the working and short term memory can only remember sequences of seven plus or minus two pieces of information. Meaning that three to four pieces of information is easy for just about everyone. That might not seem like a lot, but remember that *your short term memory is, like we said, just a temporary stage that information passes through for about ten to fifteen seconds before going into longterm memory, assuming that the hippocampus deems it's worthy*. It's also worth noting that some people can remember larger chunks of information. If you're curious, you can try to remember chunks of up to seven, eight, or even ten numbers to see where you get stuck. From there, you know how small of chunks you need to break things into. *The chunking system is very good because it's an entry level mnemonic technique. It's not only much faster and easier to learn and play with than some of the heavier visual memory techniques we're going to learn later, but it's also a critical element of the overall technique. This is to say that even after we teach you the methods to remember things way more easily, you're still going to be chunking details or memories into groups of three or four so that they can better comply with the requirements of your short term memory. Sure, we could train your short term memory to hold a larger number of items, but that would only slow you down and place a larger cognitive load on you. At three to five items there is no slow down so it's preferable to work in this range. Furthermore, by chunking groups of items into one entity, we can stack five chunks of five objects each into our working memory and effectively store 25 items in our short term or working memory without any cognitive overload. Because of this massive advantage, you'll notice that all of the world's top memory athletes use systems that are based on chunking combined with powerful visual and spatial memory techniques that we'll be learning later on in the course. The other nice thing about chunking is that it works with just about everything. Take a sequence of numbers or a couple pieces of information. For example, brown dog, tall fence, lost Frisbee. You can even try to chunk information about people into neat little bundles. It might seem strange, but remembering that information in chunks is actually much easier than if it were to be put all together*. The brown dog who saw the tall fence where the Frisbee was lost. Chunking is a well documented psychological phenomenon and we've provided some further reading on it in the PDF syllabus in case you're interested. In the next lecture, we're going to give you a worksheet to show you the power of chunking and to practise this foundational skill a little bit. While we haven't gotten to the really incredible memory techniques yet, you'll already start seeing some improvements if you start breaking information into chunks and this skill is going to come in handy later

*Demonstration: Chunking*

One of the areas that gets students stuck early, early on in the course is *Chungking, and that's because students often misconceive it as a technique when in fact, what Chungking is is kind of a psychological phenomenon*. It's kind of the ways, one of the ways that our brains work and a hack around our memory. But it's not so much a technique as it is a phenomenon. And I'd like to walk you through the chunking worksheet really quickly, which you're about to do in this course, and explain to you exactly how it needs to be done and then give you some context as to why this understanding that you're going to gain from this worksheet is so important. So here we have the newly redesigned chunking worksheet, and you can see that we explain that it is a diagnostic tool. It is not meant as a training worksheet. And you can go ahead and read the instructions, but I'm going to walk you through exactly how you do it. So essentially, what you need to do in this exercise is you print the worksheet out and you keep two separate pages. Then what I'd like for you to do is start out with the first row, look at it, memorize it, and then hide it and go to the blank page and fill it out. It'll be very easy for you. You probably remember that it was five eight, two four. And I'm not going to do all of this because I want you guys to have three of them to do on your own. But what you will realize as you go through, maybe you'll be able to do the second row, maybe you'll even be able to do the third row. But the point of this exercise is not to train your working memory. It is to demonstrate that by the time you get down here, you're going to need to break these up like a credit card is broken up or like a phone number is broken up. You're going to need to remember either three or four numbers separately. And by doing that, if you remember, OK, I have here let's say six two three eight seven 029. You see how I pause there. Now, I can remember here six oh three eight seven zero two nine. And what's weird about the way our brains work is if you try to remember six to eight, seven, nine, without chunking it, without doing that separation, somehow it would be much more difficult. So the point of this is for you to understand and witness that phenomena and see where it happens is it happened at three? Does it happen at four? Does it happen at five? Does it happen at seven for most of you? If not all of you, it'll happen at five.

Now, why is that important? Why have you do this? Why not just explain to you, hey, this is chunking and this is why it's important and this is why credit cards are broken up and phone numbers are broken up into three or four digits. Well, when we get into the activities here, we have this super learner game server. When we get into the other activities, *you're going to be learning about markers, visual markers, and you're going to be learning about compound markers and combining chunking multiple details* in so that when you go to a very difficult challenge, such as random words. Or the even more difficult challenge, random words around two and you get 20 words, you understand that you don't need to try and memorize 20 words. That is the same as trying to memorize a line of 12 to 15 numbers. In fact, what you need to do is break them into chunks and you can do it however you want. For example, I would probably just take the ones in this corner here tomorrow. A user has a central stove session. Now, how do I create a marker for those five words? And you'll see there are demonstrations where we show you exactly how to do this. We have many students who do this in two to three minutes easily. *But the point is for you to understand this is where chunking shines is instead of creating one visualization for each word, you're going to do the same thing that world memory champions and memory athletes do, which is chunk things together*. So all you need to remember is that it's confusing or it confuses to initially wrap your search. That might not be the one I use. *I might pick some different chunks here, but by condensing and memorizing three to four things at once, think of it kind of like compression. I need one visualization and I've chunked four to five different words or pieces of information into that visualization*. So I hope that helps. I hope that prevents you from getting stuck on the chunking worksheet or not understanding how you're supposed to be training. You're not you're just supposed to use it as a diagnostic so that you understand the psychological phenomenon that is chunking. And later on you will learn how to use it.

*Dual Coding & ‘Brute Force’ Learning*

By now, you understand a lot about how the different types of memory work and what's required for adults to learn new information. Maybe you've even started thinking about ways to adhere to these protocols and ways that you could change your learning process to maximise your success. One such strategy is an important practise called *dual coding*. *Remember how we learned that the brain has different buffers for working memory depending on the type of information it's interacting with?* *Well, in dual coding, we try to get different types of working memory buffers to activate at once, thereby increasing the chances of retention and storage in long-term memory. In the coming lectures, we are going to emphasise how important it is to look at a text or a piece of information from different angles, to ask different types of questions and to use different senses, such as vision and smell, or even emotion, to engage with the material in different ways than you normally would. And this is why. This is also why we advocate a style of learning that I like to call "brute force" learning. This is a term that has been lifted from hacking, where a hacker will attack a server by trying thousands or even tens of thousands of passwords in the same form rapidly, often with a few different machines or different angles. What does this have to do with learning though? Well, as we've just established, the most successful learners attack a piece of material from many angles and perspectives. They read about it, they check out contrasting opinions about it from different sources, they jot down some notes, they teach a few friends about it, they try it out themselves, they look at pictures, you get the idea. All of these different approaches and methods reinforce the learning, connecting it to other types of memory, such as experiential memories, and overall they strengthen the neural network associated with what you are trying to learn. My point is that if you want to learn effectively, at some point you'll need to get your nose out of the book and engage with the material in different ways, from different angles that appeal to you, and apply to the material at hand. *A great example of this, by the way, would be to try and explain to some of your friends what you learned in the last few lectures about your memory and about chunking. By teaching this information, you force your brain to look at it from a different angle, to deconstruct it, to form it into your own words, and then to present it in a compelling way. As they say, something once taught is something twice learned, and we would absolutely love to see you get out there and share what you've learned with your friends so far*. Since you, as an adult learner, need to be self-directed and make decisions about your experience in order to learn effectively, we leave a lot of the stuff up to you. Though, in the coming chapters, we will give you lots of different exercises to choose from and ensure that your learning is very multidimensional.

=== Section 3: The Incredible Power Of Visual Memory

*Why Images Are The Most Powerful Way To Remember & Learn*

Evolution has yielded us some pretty interesting skills. Sure, as a species, we've been telling oral histories for tens or even hundreds of thousands of years, but this pales in comparison to the amount of time that we've been hunting and gathering. Our brains and our bodies developed over millions of years of roaming the savanna looking for areas with food and scoping out different types of nuts and berries and interacting with all the different types of critters we found along the way. Why does this matter? *Well, it means that we can not only spot an approaching predator very quickly, we can also remember visual information, or pictures, far faster and with more clarity than we can remember things like spoken words*.

This skill is super useful if you, as a palaeolithic hunter-gatherer, need to remember where you saw that herd of buffalo going or what that berry looked like that made everyone really, really sick. Because of this evolutionary development, visual information is simply easier to recall than auditory information. *It also has to do with the fact that pictures are more heavily encoded and they speak to different types of working memory buffers, as we mentioned before. Pictures are imbued with rich and detailed information, such as colour, context, shape, and size, and they're more likely to have a higher number of neural connexions, as they convey emotion and depth, interaction, and so much more. As they say, a picture is worth a thousand words. Visual information is also alarmingly fast. Research has demonstrated that we can comprehend the contents of an image in just a fraction of a second.* To demonstrate this, I want to walk you through an exercise. I'm going to show you a picture, and I'm going to show you this picture for a pretty long time, two whole seconds, and I want you to try and understand as much detail as you can about it. What are the people doing? How are they feeling? What is the context? Are you ready? Now, you just saw that picture for a pretty short amount of time, but I bet if I asked you to, you could write me at least a paragraph about the colours and the composition, where things were laid out and what the meaning and significance of the photo is. Perhaps you could even write two paragraphs or maybe, if you're a particularly good writer, you could describe it in three paragraphs of 1,000 words. Ultimately, a photo is just information, and what you just did is the equivalent of reading information at something on the order of 30,000 words per minute. That's three times faster than the world record speed reader. Look at you, you evolved person you. It's totally amazing.

*This little demonstration shows us just how effective it is to see things as pictures and symbols rather than auditory information. For this reason, in addition to all the other steps we have to take to prime our memory, it's best that we also learn to transform concepts, ideas, and other important information into imagined visual pictures, or what we call markers, as soon as we possibly can. It won't surprise you to learn, additionally, that the best and most memorable types of visual markers are strange, bizarre, or emotionally connected to memories. After all, adult learners need to connect information to pre-existing knowledge, and as always, our hippocampi are busy working away to determine what stuff matters and what stuff doesn't*. The same is true of images we're hoping to remember. But we'll be covering that in a little bit more detail soon.

For now, I want to tell you a pretty interesting story that actually happened while I was building the original version of this course. I was chatting with a neuroscientist from Austria about the process of learning and neural networks and things like that. More specifically, we were discussing the process of learning languages and why it was that she was struggling so much to learn new vocabulary words. The conversation progressed towards the various different ways to learn and what types of things she found easier or more difficult to remember. It was then that she recanted a story to me from when she was in med school, long before she started to understand how the brain functions. Now, apparently, one of her first tasks was to memorise all of the bones in the human body, which is a pretty momentous task. She explained to me that she struggled a great deal with this first memorization assignment. This is because they were simply looking at the bones in a diagram, a very undetailed image in a textbook without any emotional connexion or experiential component to it. She said she struggled and struggled, but then one of the next assignments she had was to memorise all of the ligaments in the human body. Now, this may sound even more daunting, because there are over 900 tiny, little ligaments throughout the entire body. However, the way that they learned that as a class was by dissecting a cadaver, top to bottom. She told me, quote, "I promise you, "I'll never forget a single ligament in the human body." Now, one thing that really caught my attention is how she described the experience. She told me, "Those images will never leave my mind." Now, I think it's important to draw a conclusion from this, and it's important to realise that in both situations, both the textbook with the bone diagrams and the cadaver, there were images involved.

*However, the detailed, experiential images, the emotionally significant experience of interacting with a dead body, and the very concrete, minute details are what allowed her to memorise the ligaments much better than the bones*.

This is actually a really interesting segue, because in the next sessions, we're going to be talking about what types of images are poignant and most memorable. We're also going to talk more about how we can better store images laced with significance and meaning to improve the chances that they end up in our long-term memory. But before we do all of that, we suggest checking out some of the recommended materials in the PDF syllabus for some really awesome podcasts, some great books, and some inspiring TED talks that describe the amazing power of visual memory.

*When & Why Creativity Training May Be Necessary*

*In the last lecture, we told you that one of the goals of SuperLearning is to transform any and every piece of information you want to remember into an image, which we call, a marker*. Perhaps this struck you as odd, or perhaps you wondered how exactly this is possible. Indeed, one of the areas of difficulty that has emerged since the original course, is one of creatively generating markers for the information students may choose to learn. This is because, yeah, it takes creativity to try and rapidly generate a mental image for things. Especially if the things you're trying to generate images for, aren't something simple or basic. Sure, just about anyone can conjure up an image of a coffee cup but what about generating an image for an abstract concept, like evolution? Now that takes creativity, or at least a Google Image search. Fortunately, it turns out that creativity is something that we're all born with. And, although we lose it through our conventional education and maturity, we can easily gain it back with just a little bit of practise. For some of you, this practise won't be too necessary. Many of you are already highly creative and will have no difficult generating these images. But, for some of you, it will be a bit of challenge, but it's nothing you can't overcome with a few short sessions of practise. Now, it turns out that Dr. Lev has actually written entire books on the subject of creativity and so he has shared a very lengthy blog post for this lecture on how you can shift your thinking towards creativity. It goes into some of the thought exercises and behaviours you can assume in order to become more creative, and you should make sure to check it out on the PDF syllabus. Additionally, there's one simple exercise used by professionals in schools all over the world, that can be highly, highly, effective at testing creativity and at re-stimulating the mind to think creatively and develop the thought patterns.

*It's called The Multiple Uses Test and it goes like this. Grab the nearest object to you, perhaps it's a pen, perhaps it's a keyboard, perhaps it's a sheet of paper, it doesn't really matter. Now, write out as many uses as you can think of for that object. Chances are, if you're about average, you can think of around 20 uses and even if you generate 20, you'll probably find that they fall into about seven plus or minus two chunks of similar uses or things that are really close to one another*. You see, even when being creative, your brain is constrained by the ways you've traditionally used it. But, what if I told you that often times, children can think of 40 or more uses for any given object, with dozens of completely different chunks. They're able to think extremely creatively, describing the pen as a jousting sword for a mouse, or a balance mouse for a miniature gymnast, or a flagpole for a colony of ants. Many more things that you and I probably wouldn't of thought of. The beauty is that, within a few sessions, of practising this exercise, for just a few short minutes, you can actually kick-start your creativity and get it back up to those higher levels. Very quickly, and with a little bit of practise, you'll realise that you can approach the objects or anything, from different perspectives. Where most adults get stuck is that, they don't realise, you can change the object and still use it. You can break the pen, take the ink and turn it into warpaint. You can take the spring out and use it to protect your iPhone cable. *But, you can go much further, thinking about things that are completely unrelated to the object, things you may like or dislike*. Now, think again about the object and see how it could relate to that scenario. Using the example of a pen, I could think about how much I enjoy flying a drone, and then consider that the pen could be used to decorate the drone or to put a little flag on the ground where the drone takes off. You get the idea. By going from the perspective, back to the object, you unlock a whole new layer of potential uses that most adults, don't even consider. All of this practise will greatly help you when you have to think of novel images to represent abstract intellectual concepts, like evolution. We're also training your visualisation skills, which as you've probably guessed, are going to be absolutely critical in the coming weeks. In the PDF syllabus, you'll find a couple articles with exercises and strategies, to improve your creativity. I hate to sound like a broken record, but it is up to you as a self-directed adult learner, to decide if this is something that you need to vest your time in.



*What Types Of Images Come Naturally To You?*

Previously, we talked about how images in general are some of the most memorable pieces of information for our minds. Now, there are different types of images of course, and different types will be more effective for different types of people. In the next section, we'll work on improving the types of images we imagine, and more specifically, their quality, so don't worry if you don't understand this stuff just yet. For now though, let's do a really quick test to determine what types of images are most natural for you to imagine. We're going to determine if you naturally gravitate towards a stereotypical image, a personal image, a fictional image, or a graphical image. From there, we know what types of images you should be imagining and which ones will be most effective for you as we move throughout the course. So, I want you to imagine a coffee cup. You can close your eyes if you want, or keep them open, but imagine that coffee cup as vividly as possible. What is the design of the coffee cup? How tall is it? How full? Now, what type of image did you choose? Is it a stereotypical coffee cup that you might have seen in a catalogue? Is it one that you just made up? Is it a coffee cup that maybe you remember from a previous experience? Or, maybe it's actually a drawing of a coffee cup. Now take note of this, because this is most likely your ideal style of image. Of course, if you can choose a coffee cup that already has those neural links, such as the one your mother used to sip from when she made you breakfast, that's the best. It'll allow you to link new information about coffee and coffee cups in general to those pre-existing, deeply encoded memories. *As you know doubt remember, connecting new information to existing, strong and inter-connected neural networks is probably the best way to guarantee that the hippocampi will start paying attention*. Sometimes you'll get personal images and sometimes not. Sometimes you'll have the same image for a concept, and sometimes it'll be a randomly generated one. When I picture a coffee cup, it's sometimes red and sometimes yellow, but it's never a coffee cup that I've actually seen in the past. It's just a random, imaginary image of a coffee cup with slightly rounded edges and a white brim. *Ultimately, you have to learn to go with what images come naturally for you. Try to lean towards whatever type of image you find most conductive for you to remember, #but just make sure that, number one, there's as much detail as possible#*. You're not just picturing some vague image of a coffee cup, but a red coffee cup, about half full, with a little handle and a textured finish. How sharp are the angles? What shade is the colour? With time and practise, you're going to learn, not just how to generate these images extremely quickly, to represent anything you want to learn, but also to link them to other pieces of information. You'll also probably develop fixed markers for subjects that you spend a lot of time reading about. I, for example, always visualise the same image from a particularly memorable lunch I had with a friend at Facebook headquarters every single time I read about an article with Facebook as a company in it. *With time, you too will build up a visual library like this one, which will make calling up images much faster and make it much easier to link together strings of images to form complex concepts that easily convert into long term memory*. Don't worry, we'll be there before you know it.

=== Section 4: Mental Markers: Visual Memory Meets Learning

*How Do We Apply Visual Memory To Reading?*

Since so much of what we learn today comes from books and other forms of written materials, you're probably wondering how we're going to apply the visual memory techniques we've been learning to reading. This is a great question, and it's one of the biggest areas of confusion for most students. After all, it's extremely difficult, maybe even impossible, to generate visual markers while your brain's visual processing power is focused on reading and looking at the symbols on the page. This lecture will explain how it all works. If it's confusing at first, don't worry, because there are plenty of demonstrations and additional lectures on this process coming up soon.

*One of those future lectures will come up when we get to speed reading, and it'll explain in detail how you'll use regular intervals of pauses during your reading. This is not just because speed reading is very exhausting for the eyes and for the brain, but also because these pauses allow us to optimise the process of learning*.

Think of this as a sort of Adam Smith division of labour type thing, if you've studied economics, or if you've read Tim Ferriss' work, it's what he calls batching like tasks. It's a very well known productivity and efficiency trick, used in factories and companies all over the world, and we're just applying it to reading.

*You see, just like there are at least three types of memory, there are also three stages, or processes, of memory. They are, encoding, storage, and retrieval. Where most people get into trouble is that they try to do all three at once. Have you ever read a paragraph or a page of text only to realise that you've been deeply immersed in thought and you haven't actually paid attention to anything that you just read? This is what happens when you're trying to do all three memory processes at once. On the other hand, if you've ever studied process operations management or economics, you know that grouping similar tasks together is an efficient way to minimise waste. I mean, you don't wash one shirt at a time and then put it in the dryer all by itself. You wash all of your clothes together, put them all in the dryer together, and then fold them when they're all done, right? With reading, you've been doing it one shirt at a time, trying to multitask the washing and drying and folding for each shirt. It's just as inefficient as it sounds, and so we're going to separate it out into three separate processes to reduce cognitive strain and improve overall efficiency*.

*Now I know what you're thinking, how exactly do we do that? Well, because of the limitations on your short term memory and the inherent difficulty in multitasking visualisation with reading, we'll be learning how to make short pauses of about one to two seconds after each page, or even take micro pauses of just fractions of a second after reading information-dense paragraphs. You'll also take longer pauses every 10 minutes or less to review what you've already hopefully put into the beginning stages of long term memory. As we're going to discover, when we learn about space repetition software, you brain needs to periodically repeat and review information in increasingly long intervals in order to remember it and prove to the hippocampi that it's relevant and worth remembering. This is similar to the idea that you must continue weight training to improve your strength and increase muscle mass. If your brain, like your body, thinks that the information you're using is a one off occurrence, it won't waste the time investing the resources to remember it*.

*In short, this is why we take small pauses after each page and much longer pauses of 15 to 30 seconds after each chapter, to play back and retrieve our stored markers and perform a form of spaced repetition to improve our long term retention. This also means that it's not a bad idea to spend a few minutes a week reviewing markers and ideas from books you've read months or even years before, if you really wish to remember them*.

Don't worry, we're gonna go into a procedure and a habit for all that stuff later on in the course. But for now, you need only to be aware of this process and how it works. Before we can get into any of this, we need to master the concept of markers, or the quick visual associations that we've been learning about up until now.

*While we're discussing images and visual markers, it's worth noting that not all markers have to be visual. In fact, smell is actually a more memorable sense than vision. Of course, we can't understand an entire book using our sense of smell alone, and so we're focusing on images, but if you read about, say, chocolate, and you can conjure up the smell or the taste of chocolate, that's actually a great marker for remembering that data point. And if it works for you, even better. Whatever types of markers we use, whether they're visual or sensory or some other types that we have yet to learn about, it'll almost certainly be a mix in the end. This mix of markers, when retrieved and reviewed, reminds us of the details that we've decided we need to remember. And when combined with our existing knowledge and opinions and ideas about the content, it allows us to dual code and store information into long term memory very quickly and very effectively*.

*So, instead of reading back over the chapter, we can retrieve all of the markers we've created and start thinking about how they're connected together logically. We play them back almost like a film strip in our minds, and that helps our retrieval*.

It also, as an added benefit, serves as little landmarks throughout the page, which if we need an extraordinarily detailed level of information, like exact dates, we can actually go back because we have our landmarks of markers and they tell us exactly where we need to find that information. In time, we'll be learning to sight read, which will take visual information in the form of words and symbols and convert them much more quickly and efficiently into sets of markers that relate to one another and form a cohesive picture. We're getting there, but for now just be patient, and keep working hard on your foundational memory skills like markers and chunking.

*Demonstration: Visualization Of Words And Concepts From Text*

Now that we have an understanding of how visualisation can be helpful during reading. Let's see how it actually works. In this lecture I'm going to ahead and read at a very slow pace and describe the kinds of visualisations that I generate and try to describe them in vivid detail. And then I'll be mapping them and I'll try to find Google images that somewhat come close to the markers or visual images that come to mind from me. Now, if this lecture is a bit overwhelming, don't worry. I'm going to explain how and why I chose the visualisations that I did in the upcoming lectures. And then we'll return to some practical examples and demonstrations. This lecture is merely here to provide a demonstration that we can later deconstruct together in the coming lectures. So for this demonstration, I'm going to use a Wikipedia article on the garden city movement. Now typically Wikipedia articles are very dense, so this example is a pretty rigorous and challenging one and it will give us lots of opportunities to generate markers in a very short amount of text. So, the first thing that I notice, obviously is garden city movement. Now I happen to live in a garden city of Tel Aviv, so I picture Rothschild *Boulevard*, which is a very green area. And I'm picturing a specific block. And in front of a specific restaurant that I know, where the trees are particularly vivid, and green, and full of life. The next thing that I'm gonna notice, obviously *1898*. It's actually for me to come up with a marker for that so I don't particularly come up with one. The next think I'm gonna notice, you see these camel case and this link, I notice *Ebeneezer Howard*. Now, Ebeneezer is a pretty rare name. I have only one neural note for that name and it's Ebeneezer Scrooge. So< I come up with an image of him. I'm picturing an actual image in my mind of Ebeneezer Scrooge which is familiar to me. You may picture the version of Scrooge that was in the cartoons you watched as a kid. Next, I notice United Kingdom. I actually don't come up with a flag of the United Kingdom here because sometimes for me it's confusing with the other flags of the Commonwealth, which all have that Union Jack symbol on them. Instead I actually come up with a *map of England*, specifically, but kind of an entire map of the United Kingdom, it looks like this. Next up I see *green belts*. That's pretty easy. I come up with a green leather belt and particularly I see it on a pair of blue jeans, but a green belt is a good marker in general. Let's move on to the next paragraph. I notice immediately the word *utopian*. I immediately see a white marble city square with a big round fountain in the middle. I see this in very vivid detail. I don't really have anything for looking backward but I kind of picture a guy in a top-hat, who's looking over his shoulder. Now I notice *Henry George*, okay. By connecting to existing knowledge I realise that those both happen to be the names of British kings. And this works really well for us because it will remind us that Ebeneezer Howard was British. So I imagine an image of King George during the King's Speech. I'm imagining by the way the father not the son. Now moving on, for progress and poverty I actually see children during the Great Depression and they're standing in line. Now, let's keep reading, garden cities of tomorrow. So I already have a marker for the garden city and so that comes up again. Now if we keep going I have 1902. I happen to know that there was actually a World's Fair that was supposed to happen in New York, but that was cancelled, so I'm envisioning that a cancelled World Fair would probably look like people rolling machinery and equipment back into a warehouse looking disappointed. Now, 32,000, that's kind of a strange number. Oddly enough the first thing that comes to mind for me is that it's roughly 32 gigabytes. And I actually picture an iPhone 3gs, because that's a product that comes in a variant of 32 gigabytes. For 6000 nothing particularly comes to mind very quickly. Alright, let's see, six radial boulevards. Okay, that's interesting. I actually picture a hub and spoke, kind of like a waggon wheel though the one that I'm picturing has only six spokes and radial is the word that I want to remember here. Now for boulevards I picture the planned community where I purchased my first home, which was called Boulevard. What else do we have here? What else do we have here? It's worth noting by the way that we have these images on the side and these can actually serve as really, really great markers as well. Not to get distracted. We have a cluster of several garden cities as *satellites*. Okay, that's an important point. Now for satellites I actually picture a giant space telescope, the *Hubble Space Telescope*. It's probably kind of a strange example but you might think of a communications satellite more readily, I have a very vivid image already in my memory of what that satellite looks like so that's easy for me to come with and I jump to it right away. Okay, let's jump into early development. Howard's To-morrow,: a peaceful path to real reform. Okay, peaceful path, I wanna remember that because that's the title of his book. Well I actually picture here, an Israeli and Palestinian flag, it's kind of my personal marker for *reform and peace* because it's a highly emotional, poignant point to me. But you might picture an *olive branch*. Now another one of his books, this is an important detail. Okay, Garden Cities of Tomorrow, again that same marker of jumping back to Rothschild Boulevard but here I immediately after this jump to overcrowding and deterioration. Okay, *overcrowding* that's important. I actually see a huge square of people pushing and shoving and it's just complete chaos. Now, let's keep reading. I hope you're reading along with me. *Working class*, okay that's important. The first thing that comes to me here is actually someone in very dirty overalls. One of the straps of the overalls is kind of let loose and it's like the overalls are hanging off of his body. And I can literally see the dirt under his fingernails. Maybe he's a coal miner. I can actually see his particular hairstyle, it's kind of like someone out of the movie O Brother Where Art Thou? So again, it's a very detailed that comes to me. You'll notice by the way that sometimes I skip over particular words or concepts like 6,000. I couldn't come up with something very quick for that, so I just chose to make a marker for 32,000 instead. You'll also notice that I took very particular details, they're not generic or fuzzy images. *So now I have Henry George in my memory. I have 32,000 in my memory. I have overcrowding in my memory. And all the other markers are there too. So now I just need to playback these detailed images and what that's going to do is give me an overall picture of what was happening during the time that the garden city movement was promoted.* I now can deduct from the details to know that it was a response to overcrowding. It is was a response to criticism from the working classes. And it was a response to the criticism that cities were becoming too overcrowded. I also know from my marker of 1902 and my marker of Ebeneezer, I know who was doing the promoting and what was really bringing this movement to life and also where it was happening. I even know the basic principles of how garden cities are designed. Just by reviewing my markers. Now, let's deconstruct this demonstration and see just how it works.

Just like I mentioned before, this might be a bit overwhelming, just because it's a little bit advanced and Wikipedia articles, like I said are way more dense than the typical stuff that you'll be reading. It's kind of like watching a gymnastics teacher do a back flip before explaining to you how he did it. So, if you have seen how visualisation works that's great, we're going to deconstruct it and explain each component of it in detail in the coming lectures and it will be a lot less overwhelming when you do it with less dense materials than this Wikipedia article.

*Creating Effective Markers For Better Memory*

OK, you probably have a lot of questions and are wondering how you're going to learn how to do what you just saw, after all, what I just demonstrated is a little bit more advanced than where we are today. So let's deconstruct it and see how it works. As you've likely figured out by now, *markers* are really at the heart of the entire super learning methodology. And for this reason, we will spend a good amount of time understanding and practicing them in a very, very nitty gritty, detailed sort of way.

*So what makes a good, high quality, memorable marker that can be easily linked and stored in our long term memory?* Why did I choose the specific images I did in the demonstration video and why did I visualize them the way that I did? Well, *first and foremost, markers represent a concept or an idea, not a generic fluffy concept idea, but rather a very specific picture that articulates a concrete concept, one that can be easily retrieved from memory*. For example, you would create just one marker for an entire paragraph because there are likely two or three or even more clusters of important words or points in the paragraph that each deserve a marker. For this reason, rather than summarizing an entire paragraph with just one marker, you would do better to encode each of the significant ideas of the paragraph and let all those details together add up to one summarizing marker. For example, I had the Garden City, Ebenezer Howard, the United Kingdom and more. *Now, the more detailed and specific, the better*. Over time, of course, you won't remember all of these markers, and that's OK, because your brain will merge all of the ideas and details into overall summaries of the key major ideas. But encoding a high level of detail as you go along allows you to maintain a high level of comprehension. And it's important for spaced repetition as you go through the reading material later on and review what you're learning. *The next important criteria is that our markers are imbued with rich details*. They're not foggy or generic mental images. This means that rather than picturing a generic, grumpy old men, I pictured a very specific and detailed image of Ebenezer Scrooge. I can tell you what color his hat is and what expression he's making in the photo. We do all this in as much detail as we possibly can, and if the details are given in the text, this will be very easy and it'll help you remember specific and particular details as you read them. *However, even if descriptive details are not given, you should create your own because this mental process will make the images much more memorable.* Now, it's important to emphasize that just because we have a high level of detail doesn't mean that we are spending a long time creating each marker. As we demonstrated earlier on, our brains can picture or recognize highly detailed images in fractions of a second, and the research supports this. *So when I say that I'm picturing a very detailed image, it doesn't actually mean that it should take any longer. It just means I'm making sure that the images that pop up have a level of detail*. That means that they are either specific images from memory or images that we can describe with a high level of vivid detail. The third important criteria of each marker is that it can be easily connected to other markers that come with it. We'll cover that in more detail later. But for now, it's important that you understand that by using these highly detailed markers, we are able to remember more details with fewer memory points, a sort of chunking or compression of memory information, because each detail encodes some information. An example of this is that my marker for Henry George happened to be a British historical figure, and my marker for Garden Cities was Rothschild Boulevard, a green boulevard in a real garden city by selecting markers. This way we create stronger linkages or neural networks between each one of our memory points as they're all tied together and represented by the details of the markers themselves. I want to point out that remembering the details as opposed to the overall concept is a very important point, because if we go from the micro level details or concepts, Henry, George, poverty, radial spokes or the UK back to the original concept, we have no problem remembering the overarching ideas and concepts of the Garden City. But if I tell you the original concept, for example, Garden City, you might forget the. Hills, furthermore, when you're reading, you are emerged deep in the nitty gritty details of the text, and so you have no way of creating a big summarizing, overarching marker that describes the entire concept, doing so would be like creating a map of the entire forest while standing in front of one tree. So instead, we focus on memorizing those individual ideas and concepts and we can reverse engineer the overall concept and meaning and context from them over time. As you go back and review the prior pages of the book, more on that later, your brain will create linkages and start to connect one specific visualization with the entire overarching idea that it represents. In fact, when I interviewed Swedish memory champion Matthias Ribbing, he explained to me that whenever he gives a public lecture, he is able to memorize the entire newspaper for that day and recite it back to astounded audiences. How does he do it? Well, while Matthias is reading, of course, he is creating tons of detailed mental markers about the different ideas and characters in the news articles. But when it comes time to actually memorize the article, he chooses one particularly representative marker that adequately summarizes the entire article's ideas. And then he memorizes that to a sufficient level of detail that will allow him to recite back the contents of the article. This is a bit confusing, so let's go ahead and explore a very specific example that I love to use.

This example comes from Benjamin Franklin's autobiography, one of the most entertaining books that I've read in the last five years. In my mind, I have a marker of Benjamin Franklin running up and down the street with a wheelbarrow full of paper. This marker comes from a very specific story he tells of ingenuity in marketing, an early form of guerilla marketing, which he used to convince people that his business was thriving and in doing so, attract customers. Years after reading the book, I have forgotten many of the surrounding detailed markers. For example, I don't remember how many times per day he ran up and down the street or what year he did it in. But I remember the overall detailed image and what it represents to me. As you'll notice, this marker represents a very specific concrete and easy to visualize detail of the overall idea, the idea that Benjamin Franklin owned a printing press in the early days of Philadelphia. Business was slow. He needed to figure out a way to speed up business in a time where people weren't really printing a lot and didn't have a need to print their own texts. Now, he understood that if people saw other people were ordering printed products, then they too would start seeing it as a necessary part of their own businesses and so on and so on and so on. But all of those things are pretty hard to visualize. And so I chose to visualize a simple yet highly memorable story that perfectly encapsulates what I chose to remember. Do you see how my marker is one specific, detailed visualization that represents the whole situation? I see the wheelbarrow. I see Benjamin Franklin in his round glasses, the mud on his boots as he runs through the unpaved streets. But this highly detailed marker is, in fact, representing a broader concept. Now, here's another strikingly similar example in the best selling book, What the Dog Saw, Malcolm Gladwell tells the story of a salesman selling a kitchen contraption on the boardwalk for 40 years, though I read the book around five years ago and I haven't been as good at reviewing as I should be. I still remember the detailed visualization of the salesman demonstrating his product with a pineapple tantalizingly placed on his stand. Years later, the detail that I remember is not the exact nature of the contraption or how much he even sold it for. The image I remember is the uncut pineapple, which in my mind has become the representation of the overarching idea in this story. Keep your audience wanting more. Makes sense. *This leads me to the fourth critical aspect of a good marker, and it probably won't come as any surprise. Good markers can be easily and quickly converted to images*. Of course, you have to be able to easily and quickly convert it into an image with time. As you become more creative, you'll be able to convert just about any thought or idea into some kind of an image in the beginning. However, there are definitely some concepts that are easier to generate markers for than others. For example, if I read a paragraph that discussed the relationship of DNA to the study of genetics, which one do you think would make for a better marker? He'll probably agree that we can quickly convert the idea of DNA into an image of a double helix. Genetics, however, is a much harder concept to visualize, and so we should probably go with the double helix. *The fifth important point to consider when creating markers is the differentiation between problems and solutions*. If the paragraph you're reading presents both a problem and a solution or a conflict and a resolution, it's always better to prioritize the solution or resolution, not the question. You'll note that I placed an emphasis on Radio Boulevard's greenbelts and 32000, why is this, you ask? Well, just like we choose to remember details before broad ideas, you can generally backtrack your way to the problem, in this case, overcrowding from the solution very easily. Oftentimes the question is found in the answer, so to speak. I mean, think back to my example with Benjamin Franklin. If I remember that Benjamin Franklin had to run up and down the street with a wheelbarrow to generate business, it's easy to remember the problem. Nobody was ordering printed materials in colonial Philadelphia. But if I remember the problem, it's much easier to forget the solution. *The sixth and last element of a good marker is that it connects to existing knowledge whenever possible*, just like I connected to my knowledge about British kings, Internet means and the city that I live in now. Of course, much of what you learn will hopefully be new information. And so this won't be easy. However, it is reasonable to assume that a lot of the knowledge that you're trying to acquire is closely related to existing knowledge in even the most loose or tenuous way. You may not know a lot about Napoleon, but you probably have seen a portrait of him with his hand tucked in his jacket. And even the minimal connection provided by using that image as a marker is enough to make the information just a bit more relevant to your hippocampi. And you've almost certainly seen a hundred dollar bill. So you know exactly what Benjamin Franklin looked like. This, by the way, is why sensory markers like the taste of chocolate are so effective. You've probably tasted chocolate thousands of times, and your brain knows by now that anything related to chocolate must be important. So there are the six things to keep in mind as you become better at creating markers. As we mentioned, you should try to create a marker for every single detail that seems to be important. For example, people, dates, formulas and events. This works out to be around 10 to 15 markers per page. Now, you won't always create that many and over time you certainly won't always remember them all. But that's not a big deal. Your goal as a super learner isn't to remember every single little detail in a book. It's to remember the information that you deem important and relevant. And that means big ideas, life lessons and storylines. *In a sense, you want to create markers for one hundred percent of important details so that if and when your brain forgets the 80 percent of details that are mere set up an explanation, you will still have markers for the 20 percent or less of details that are crucial for understanding. This 20 percent will become your anchor for remembering the overall thoughts and ideas in the books and articles you read. And so you want to make sure they are high quality*. Later on, you'll be learning a tool for deliberately planning exactly what it is you want to learn from each piece of text you wish to read, which will help you extract the important markers that you want to memorize and remember them indefinitely. For now, remember that it's better to be mindful and create all of these markers for significant details. You wish to remember this way when and yes, it's when, not if you forget some of your less important markers, you can reverse engineer them if necessary. Like I demonstrated with the Benjamin Franklin example, assuming we've encoded in enough detailed information, essentially we're using the bottom up method of remembering rather than the more common top down method. All this is going to take time and you're going to have to practice for a long time to create high quality markers quickly. You'll know your markers are improving when you're able to summarize and deduce the entire meaning of a concept or story simply by recalling the list of markers that you have. Now, that was quite a bit to take in. And so let's review what we've learned about high quality markers.

*First and foremost*, high quality markers represent specific ideas or concepts that can be easily understood.

*Next*, high quality markers are themselves imbued with rich detail such as colors, textures and so on.

*Third*, high quality markers are clearly and logically interconnected to one another.

*Fourth*, high quality markers emphasize outcomes or resolutions, not questions or initial conflicts

*Fifth* high quality markers come in volume. At this stage, the more the merrier.

And *finally*, markers draw upon existing memories whenever possible. Great.

Now you understand how choosing good and detailed markers will allow you to reverse engineer a much. Radar overall understanding and recall of any text in the course syllabus, you're going to start finding games and exercises that you'll do every day as homework. These exercises will give you a few images and then swarm them in a bunch of other images and ask you to remember which ones were the original images. Try doing this without markers or detail and then try encoding each of these images into a story or visualization if there's an image of a rabbit. Think of a childhood friend who had a rabbit and picture playing with that rabbit. Now try again and see how much more effective you are when you carefully duelling code details and existing memories. Most importantly, I want to say this, don't stress out about creating the absolute perfect markers. *There is no such thing as the perfect marker for you is the marker that's going to be easy to create and easy to remember*. *Simply transitioning your learning and memory process from a strictly auditory to a visual one is going to give you a quantum leap in how well you're able to memorize the things you learn*. So what if your markers aren't 100 percent perfect or you aren't sure if you created a marker for the right thing in the text? Continue practicing and pay special attention to which markers you are able to successfully remember. Over time you will adapt and improve your technique, finding something that works for you individually. And like we said, time and time again, the most successful students are not those who follow my instructions to the letter, but rather those who take them as a starting point for adapting and modifying the techniques to fit their own workflow and learning style. So pay special attention to what's working for you and what isn't. So long as you're creating visual markers for key details and concepts, you are doing just fine.

*Logical & Creative Markers*

When we read, a lot of the information we need to remember is of course the relationships between different data points such as places, people, things, forces, groups, and so much more. Now, you might be asking yourself, can we really represent these relationships between each and every piece of information using creative visual markers alone? Well, no; in fact the truth is that a huge number of our markers will actually be *logical markers*. These logical visual markers follow convergent thinking, meaning that they condense and put things together. The truth is though that logical markers are often so trivial that we don't even notice we are making them. They may be somethings as simple as a negative emotion of anger between Austria-Hungary and Serbia or as complex as a schematic or a diagram that explains all the interactions between all the different warring nations.

*Examples of logical markers can include: emotions, such as excitement, anger, or confusion; symbols, such as question marks or exclamation points; arrows, x's, circles, and check marks, and even diagrams, schematics, or flow charts*. Which logical markers you use is going to be highly dependent on the type of person you are, how you learn, and what parts of the brain you favour, and so much more. Personally, I would never use a schematic or a diagram as a marker, but Lev finds this technique highly, highly useful, and research supports the fact that logical markers, or interactions between markers, can actually be among the most effective markers of all. Personally, I rarely use arrows or other logical markers, but I do subconsciously use a lot of emotional markers to reflect the interactions between my visual markers, and in a way these are also a form of logical markers. So, since some of these markers are not as visual and are often subconscious, how do we verify that they are strong enough or that we are making any at all? Well, when you start out, you can run the following diagnostic test to see how your logical markers are progressing. First, you can ask yourself, what is your opinion regarding this new find? Is it expected or surprising? Is it well-proven or controversial? If you are able to generate an opinion, you likely have a strong enough logical marker to demonstrate that you've stored the logical connexions behind the information. Another great diagnostic is to ask whether or not the marker creates further links, for the same reasons. Logical markers are highly personal, and so it's primarily important just to be aware of what works best for you. *From there, you can develop your own unique mix of logical markers to complement your creative visual markers*, or vice versa.

*Trying Out Your New Skills*

As our friend Malcolm Knowles would happily remind us if he were here, *your success really depends on you using your skills and finding that they're useful in your daily life. If you don't believe that these skills are useful, you won't put in the effort and ultimately, you won't get very far at all. And so, it's only fitting that your homework is to try these new skills out with, well, just about anything*.

For example, next time a friend tells you a story, or you walk into the other room to grab something, try creating some markers and seeing how much more you can remember. This is a really cool way to avoid walking into the kitchen and forgetting what you went in there for. Another cool thing is to try to use markers to remember the names of new people you meet. Now we'll cover that in much more detail in the advanced topics, but you can already start imaging and inventing ways to adapt the method to scenarios like this and much, much more. For example, before you pick up the phone, try creating a marker of what you were doing before the interruption. It'll be extremely easy to remember what you were doing and go back to your workflow, if you have that detailed, detailed marker. Eventually, I want you to create an automatic habit or reflex, that anytime you're distracted, or anytime you want to come back to a topic during conversation, or anytime you're embarking on a new task, you create a marker. You wouldn't close a book without reflexively putting in a bookmark, would you? This is the same principle. I want you to create markers as bookmarks to remind you of what you were doing. The same goes for any time you come across a new piece of information you wish to recall. From remembering to call your friend back, to what street you need to turn on, *you can create markers for anything and everything*. Now the more you do this, the faster and more natural it's going to become, and that is going to make a huge difference. The beauty is that by having you practise markers before giving you all of the tricks and tips for adapting it to different scenarios like names, numbers and formulas, we're also training your creativity and marker generation skills, which overall, will make you much better at creating markers in the long run, even after you know all the different strategies for application. We haven't gotten to speed reading just yet either, but if you can get really, really effective at speedily crafting these high quality markers, it's going to be much faster and much easier to improve your attention when we do get to the speed reading portion of the course. *So, check out the PDF syllabus, do that assigned homework, and make sure that you're learning how to create those high quality markers*.

*Linking & Chunking Markers For Better Retention*

So, now that you understand the basics of creating markers and you've practised it a little bit in your daily life, it's important to learn more specifically how you should work with them. In the previous demonstration on the garden city movement, we didn't discuss much about how you should actually link your markers together. *We've since explained that you should be able to describe the ways that they're connected using logical markers, creating a distinct relationship between them, and also that you should be able to play them back like a film strip. But, let's take it a bit further. As we've learned, creating relationships and dense linkages between data points is going to make them more memorable to the hippocampi, and so it's important that we really learn how we can link our markers together more completely for long-term storage*. As we mentioned earlier, markers and their sub-marker details usually come in chunks, whether by paragraphs in a piece of text or by the logic that connects them together. This means that sometimes you might not chunk the details in order. For example, if a topic is discussed at length, you may take the final detail, which answers the question, and chunk it together with some of the information given at the outset of the page or chapter. Now that you've practised chunking, you'll be able to easily see how you can group markers together by different possible logical chunks. Let's illustrate this with a particularly tricky example, the grocery store. Suppose you need to go to the local store and buy 20 random items. By now, you know well enough that you need to create 20 markers, one for each of these important items. But how do you link those items together to ensure that none of them are that single, unconnected memory that drifts off into the sea of your mind? Well, if you're lucky, they're all going to be used into one meal, and you can chunk them either by the side dish or the entree that they'll be used in. But, for the sake of demonstration, let's say that you're not lucky. Let's imagine that they're just items you need to buy for your weekly shopping, and none of them have any immediate, logical relation to any of the others. Later on in the course, when we talk about memory palaces, we're going to explain how you can connect lots of completely random pieces of information, like a deck of cards, or a random string of numbers, very quickly and effectively to a physical space or location you already have memorised. But for now, let's think about several other powerful strategies for remembering the 20 markers or items on your grocery list.

In one example, you can divide, or chunk, the list items into departments. *Milk products*, such as milk, cheese, and yoghourt. *Meat products*, three sorts of sausage, chicken breast and steak, and so on. This would be like a tree data structure, similar to how mind maps work, if you're familiar with those. You could then try to visualise the packages you get at each department. Since each package is below seven items, you should be able to recall the visual image per department with great detail. As we mentioned, this is a lot like a memory palace, but you don't have to worry about all that just yet. Alternatively, since this list doesn't have a story or logical flow the way a text you read generally would, you could build your own story and visualise a sort of animation of your mother milking a cow and preparing cheese from the milk, and then throwing in some jam to make yoghourt instead, since your niece has a sweet tooth. Imagine that your niece is missing three teeth, which makes it difficult for her to bite off a chunk of sausage. Then, your niece laughs, calls your mother a chicken breast, runs away, and falls. At the end of the story, your mother puts a frozen steak on the bump on her head. Now, this is a completely ridiculous story, but it's so ridiculous that you're not likely to forget it any time soon. Of course, in general, we hope that the information you read will be interesting enough that the original, logical structure of the text will be sufficient to link your markers together. So, you can imagine Ebenezer Howard looked like Ebenezer Scrooge, and picture him designing his hub and spoke garden city on a piece of paper with a book by Henry George, who looks like King Henry from The King's Speech, on the cover, and that book is sitting on the table next to him.

This is a specific chunk of markers which forms what we could call a compound marker. In another chunk, you could imagine him drawing out the diagram with blocks of 32,000 people by pretending he had a 32 gigabyte iPhone on the table with him, and essentially, you're using your existing logical markers and connexions to chunk all the markers together exactly as they appear in the text. Amazing, isn't it? But what if the content isn't logical, or connected, or interesting enough, even in a written text? If, for example, you were memorising all the bones in the wrist. They may not seem to have such logical and neat relationships between the markers that you might hope for. For convenience sake, let's imagine that everything we now know about garden cities is just a random series of facts. How could you package all of our different markers? Well, if we were forced to connect all of these existing markers without the logic of the text, we might get something like this. Ebenezer Scrooge and King Henry VIII riding in an overcrowded carriage with radial wheels through King George's green garden on the way to their 1902 World's Fair. *Now that one image contains seven markers from the last lecture, all chunked together in an easy to remember story. You see, all we have to remember is this one compound package of markers, and we remember seven very specific details about the garden city movement. Again, we do hope that you'll be able to use the logical markers and inherent connexions between your markers to chunk them together into compound markers, and link them into a logical flow. But, as you can see, any set of markers can be chunked and linked with enough creativity. Whichever way you do it, by linking these markers in a quick and dirty way into a vivid, memorable story, or a set of chunked compound markers in the first example, you've been able to recall many more markers than you would if you had just made a simple list*. Eventually, you should be able to use the different methods of remembering different kinds of information depending on how well it's logically connected in the text. *As a rule, your list should be chunked at around four to seven objects, just to be on the safe side, but you can always have sub-chunks, or details, within the markers that contain three to four more pieces of information per marker, if the information is particularly dense*. As an example of this, a sub-marker detail might be picturing Ebenezer Scrooge with a green belt. If we determine that that particular detail was relevant. Again, we'll go into more detail about this later, but keep in mind that almost every text we read is organised in a similar structure by the internal logic of the text. The text is divided into sections, a section is divided into paragraphs and chapters, paragraphs are divided into sentences, and so on. For this reason, it's important that you never try to memorise or link a marker outside of its context if you're using this hierarchical structure. The marker should be remembered within a package or a story interconnected to the other markers in a specific and logical area of the text. This is a bit overwhelming, I know, but bear with me. *When you try to remember a list, you should visualise the first and the last item in the list in more detail than the other markers. I bet you already know why. That's right, because this will allow you to reverse engineer any details that you happen to forget. Furthermore, you'll be able to recreate the story both from the beginning and from the end. It's a good idea to practise doing this, actually. Don't spend too, too much time imagining your middle markers. As long as you have a unique mental animation to connect these markers to the markers before and after, like, my image of Ebenezer Scrooge sketching with the book on his table. When you visualise such a package marker, the whole package appears as one marker, one compound marker, with each item within the package as a detail, or a detail marker*. So, our overall marker, and you'll have to imagine this, because there's no way I could find it on the stock image website, could be Ebenezer Howard's study, where he worked on designing the garden city, whereas a detail would be the book by Henry George on the table, the radial drawing on his desk, and an overcrowded and poorer crowd outside his window, or by the green belt on his waist. By the way, take note of that logical marker I've created by putting Henry George's book on the table. That logical marker actually shows that Ebenezer Howard was inspired by his work. Pretty cool, right? When making package markers, try to avoid inserting information that was not originally in the text, because these techniques are powerful, and you'll likely remember that information as well. So, it probably wasn't a great idea to add that carriage to my earlier example, unless I'm sure that I won't forget that the radial wheels are actually what matters. *We really wanna make the recall process as simple and non-ambiguous as possible*. It's important that you experiment with the different ways of chunking and packaging markers, and different levels of ridiculous markers to determine what's a good fit for you. These tricks of linking and chunking markers will make huge improvements to your ability to retain the markers long-term. However, for material that you need to memorise with near 100% efficiency, you can refer to the advanced lecture on memory palaces towards the end of the course.

*Demonstration: Putting It All Together With Random Facts*

So now we understand how we can link up the markers of new information. *We haven't gotten to speed reading yet but already we've greatly improved our comprehension and retention of the information that we read*. For now, I don't want you to worry about doing all of this great stuff while you actually read. Instead I want you to read and understand the information as you normally would and then take a break when you reach the end of an idea to think about the markers you would choose and how you would link them. We'll dive more into the process flow and timing of marker creation when we dive into speed reading. Now in the advanced sections of the course and in the exclusive master class lectures, we're going to show you some very specific and concrete techniques that you can use in order to apply the concept of markers to anything you might want to learn, in or out of a book. In fact in the next lecture we're going to put it all together and learn how to link markers from information that we've read. *But for now we want to give you some examples and demonstrations in this lecture to show you how to create and link markers using the marker technique*. And to demonstrate how the marker technique can be used for anything you learn, from facts to geography to people's names and so much more. These examples should help you see the types of markers we hope you'll be making as you begin to practise and apply the technique. To make this fun and interesting we've used *Google's random fact generator* to stir up some interesting tidbits of information. By the way if you ever want to practise learning random stuff, I highly recommend trying out this awesome tool. So have you ever wondered which country has the most borders? Well neither have I. But now that I mention it, I bet you're curious. It turns out it's China with 14 bordering countries. Here's some different ways I could remember this. First I could picture a map of the world but picture China maybe as a 14 sided polygon. That's not so interesting though. And how am I supposed to remember that it has 14 sides not seven sides? No that won't work. But how about picturing a Chinese looking emperor with a long wispy Chinese moustache and goatee. That's an image that is already linked to China for me except instead of having normal proportions, our emperor has seven arms on the left and seven arms on the right. For a total of 14 arms. These arms are each pushing away a foreign country symbolised by something that reminds me of that country. If I wanted to remember that the number is seven per side I could give the emperor a red outfit which is a subtle detail to remind me that the number is lucky because it connects to my existing knowledge of red being a lucky colour in Chinese culture and seven being my lucky number. Not a bad way to link up markers and existing knowledge, right? Now if I wanted to then remember each of the 14 countries, I could create a sub-marker of each one and break them into chunks by region. There are a few ways to form these chunks depending on how I think of the different countries. I could chunk them together in all of the "-stan" countries like Pakistan, Afghanistan, Tajikistan. Likely my markers would either be the flag if I can recognise the flag easily or silly markers of someone I know named Stan doing activities like packing, knitting an afghan and so on. Stan Lee would be a great person to fit in here 'cause he comes to mind immediately. I could make a nice big chunk out of the former Soviet states. I could chunk by places with a history of international military conflict for example: Russia, Mongolia, Pakistan, India and Vietnam. Any existing knowledge no matter how politically incorrect works. You can even create chunks based on the complexion of the average citizen. These markers are only for you so it's okay to have inappropriate silly or offensive thoughts. In fact it's encouraged . Someone from Bhutan might be offended that the only marker I could think of for his country was a boot. Someone from Vietnam might be offended that my marker for Vietnam is an assault rifle but if I weren't standing here explaining it to you, they wouldn't really need to know about it. Still my apologies if I've offended any of you . In any case, do notice how each detail itself becomes a sub-marker or a detail marker which is carefully linked into the central marker of our Chinese emperor. Everything from the coat he's wearing to what his arms are doing is a linked marker. Remember this because pretty soon we're going to do this with the detail markers we've accumulated during reading and pretty soon you'll be able to do it extremely quickly, even faster than I've done here.

Okay that was pretty fun, let's try another random piece of information. Here's one that I've actually wondered before: how do fish get water out of oxygen? Well first here's the answer. Gills are feathery organs full of blood vessels. A fish breathes by taking water into its mouth and forcing it out through the gill passages. As water passes over the thin walls of the gills, dissolved oxygen makes it into the blood, travels to the fish's cells. Okay cool. Come on, this one's easy, right? By now I know you all pictured a silly looking fish with bird's feathers for gills, right? Now did you also picture a lot of blood vessels weaved into those feathers? Or how about an arrow or some other kind of logical marker going from the mouth through the gills? This is a nice example because it demonstrates how the details of the markers themselves become markers that represent significant pieces of information. Alright one more. Let's make it a little bit tougher. Google is giving us, oh boy this is a tough one.

What is Eric Blair's pen name? That's because when I read the question it's really tough, I actually have no idea who the heck Eric Blair is. Fortunately as I keep reading I realise that oh he was George Orwell. This immediately generates some interest because even though I've read some of his works I had no idea that George Orwell used a pen name. Now you may or may not have read Orwell's famous book, 1984, but you almost certainly have some idea of what it's about. And even if you don't you've probably seen the Apple ad from 1984 that makes fun of IBM by suggesting that they're just like Big Brother from Orwell's book. In that case this is really easy. I picture all of those people marching towards a big screen just like in the ad except in the corner there's someone huddled up crying into a camcorder about how scary the whole scene is. That's right, you guessed it. I linked it to Blair Witch Project because that was the first and easiest visual association and image that I had with the name Blair. To make sure I know that the first name is Eric, the person holding the camera might be my cousin Eric or anyone else I know with that name. Suddenly this is a pretty easy piece of information, even if I haven't read 1984 to connect to my existing knowledge. Now did you see how I created an overall marker, comprised of animated action-packed sub-markers, each representing a significant detail about the piece of information? Now that we've seen how all this works let's try it out with a written test.

*Demonstration: Putting It All Together With Written Texts*

This is the culmination of everything that we've learned, because now we're going to try it all out, and put it all together with reading an actual text. So let me go ahead and read you a text that you've already read, just so the content is not distracting, because the focus here is on the markers and on the linking. So you've seen this already during your baseline reading speed and comprehension quiz. Now, as I read it, I'm actually going to show you the markers I create as I go along, and then I'll take brief pauses and explain them wherever necessary. So let's get started, and try to follow along with me with the text.

"Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, members of the State and of the House of Representatives: Yesterday, December 7th, 1941, a date which will live in infamy, the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan." Okay, now inside this image that I've put up here, I add details to the markers that are going to give me ... Well, the details themselves are markers, but those details within are going to give me a better understanding, so the planes that are doing the bombing, and the kamikaze planes, those are Japanese planes and they actually have flags of Japan on them, and the boats actually have American flags, and if I wanted to encode the detail that it was December 7th, 1941, I could picture that some of the people on the boat were preparing for Christmas celebrations, they're wearing Santa hats, and it was supposed to be a lucky day, the lucky number 7, but instead it was not. Let's continue reading: "The United States was at peace with that nation and, at the solicitation of Japan, was still in conversation with its government and its emperor looking toward the maintenance of peace in the Pacific." Okay, so here it's pretty quick to come up with a symbol for peace. I showed you earlier in the course that mine was the Israel-Palestinian flag, but you can also come up with an olive branch, or, in this case, I like just using the simple peace symbol, because I don't need to remember anything else except peace, and then I can overlay that onto a map of the Pacific, and that can say, that can show me, that at that time, there was peace in the Pacific. That's all I really need to know about all of that last sentence. Alright, let's go back: "Indeed, one hour after Japanese air squadrons had commenced bombing in the American island of Oahu, the Japanese ambassador to the United States and his colleague delivered to our Secretary of State a formal reply to a recent American message. And while this reply stated that it seemed useless to continue the existing diplomatic negotiations, it contained no threat or hint of war or of armed attack." Okay, there's a lot here. So first of, I picture a message that's arriving to an army base. And it's already been bombed, the army base has already been blown up, so everyone is sitting in a bunker, and they're reading the message, but it's too late. The people are shocked, and they're looking for some hint of war in the message, and they're not finding it, so they're scratching their heads. Now, this could be the main marker of this entire paragraph, because that's really the most important point that's been made here, that there was a one-hour delay, otherwise the people would still be on the deck, or if it was a longer delay they wouldn't be, they still wouldn't be there waiting for messages, and it combines the logical cause-effect of the bomb that drives people into the bunker to receive the message. So really we can actually summarise almost this entire thing with a marker of the people in the bunker receiving the message. The only reason you maybe wouldn't want to is if you need to remember December 7th, but just from the people being in the bunker and being surprised, you already know that there was peace, because otherwise they wouldn't be surprised; if they were at war, they would've been in the bunker all day. Okay? So: "It will be recorded that the distance of Hawaii from Japan makes it obvious that the attack was deliberately planned many days or even weeks ago. During the intervening time, the Japanese government has deliberately sought to deceive the United States by false statements and expressions of hope for continued peace." Okay, there are a couple of things here that come up. First, pretty quick marker to come up with, Hawaii - Japan distance. Really fast, really easy. During the intervening time, deliberately sought to deceive, well you can picture someone with their fingers crossed behind their back, and those are really quick markers. Probably I would emphasise, because of cause and effect, see the distance means that the net effect is that they were deceiving. So I would probably remember the deception, the fingers crossed behind their back. "The attack yesterday on the Hawaiian islands has caused severe damage to American naval and military forces. I regret to tell you that very many American lives have been lost. In addition, American ships have been reported torpedoed on the high seas between San Francisco and Honolulu." Here, for lives lost, we can actually use the same marker. Our takeaway is probably going to be deception, but we can use the same marker that we used earlier, of the bombings, okay? This is, by the way, the outcome, it's the result of that deception, so even if we remember just that overall marker, that's still a really good marker, *as we've said, cause and effect, you want to remember the outcome*. Okay? "Yesterday, the Japanese government also launched an attack against Malaya. Last night, Japanese forces attacked Hong Kong. Last night, Japanese forces attacked Guam. Last night, Japanese forces attacked the Philippine Islands. Last night, the Japanese attacked Wake Island. And this morning, the Japanese attacked Midway Island. Japan has therefore undertaken a surprise offensive extending throughout the Pacific area." Alright, there's a lot of details here. It's unlikely that you would want to remember all those details, but maybe you do. And again, because this is a speech, it's a little bit condensed, but what I would probably do is create a compound marker here. I would picture a map of Southeast Asia, or of all of Asia, and then over each of these countries that he's mentioned, I would just create a little animation of a bombing. Of a little explosion going up, and then when I pause after this paragraph and I review that marker, I have a little explosion over the Philippines, a little explosion over Malaya, Malaysia, I have a little explosion over Hong Kong, over Guam. So that compound animated marker is going to remember, or help me remember, what each of the countries were that was bombed. Again, I'm not sure that you would want to remember all of those, but you could, if you wanted to, using that marker.

"The facts of yesterday and today speak for themselves. The people of the United States have already formed their opinions and well understand the implications to the very life and safety of our nation." There's almost nothing in there that I would need to remember. "As Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy, I have directed that all measures by taken in our defence." Okay, Commander in Chief, the first image I go to is an image that I already have in my mind, which is George Bush, in a fighter pilot outfit. And this is because George Bush was Commander in Chief, for those of you who don't know, in the United States the President is Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy, in addition to his political roles. And George Bush was a very military active president, I mean he put us in Iraq, he put us in Afghanistan, so he's my marker for a Commander in Chief, as you can imagine. "But we will, our whole nation, remember the character of the onslaught against us. No matter how long it may take us to overcome this premeditated invasion, the American people, in their righteous might will win through to absolute victory." Again, there's not a lot of, there's not information here. These are statements that are opinions, but this isn't stuff that I really need to remember so vividly. So no markers. "I believe that I interpret the will of Congress and of the people when I assert that we will not only defend ourselves to the uttermost, but we will make it very certain that this form of treachery shall never again endanger us. Hostilities exist." Now, that we'll defend ourselves to the uttermost, that's important, that probably tells a little bit about the position of the United States right now, they're being the defender not the offender. I do want to remember that. So I come up with a marker of defence, and my marker, defending from an attack, as someone who lives in Israel, comes as the Iron Dome Missile Defence System, which shoots down rockets, so probably what I would do is I would picture one of those missile defence systems, which I've seen in person, and which has defended my neighbourhood, I would picture it maybe in Oahu, I would maybe picture it next to the White House, shooting down rockets and remember that that is the marker for defence, in that this position the United States is in defence. Okay? "There is no blinking at the fact that our people, our territory, and our interests are in grave danger. With confidence in our armed forces, with the unbounding determination of our people, we will gain the inevitable triumph, so help us God." Inevitable triumph, you know the first thing I came to was the, and pardon my pronunciation, the Arch de Triomphe in Paris. And that's a nice one, because it also helps me remember military conflict, because I, one of the most vivid images I've ever seen of it, is during the occupation of France, which was also during World War Two, and I have an image of Hitler posing in front of it. So that's a nice linked marker. It links to the idea of triumph, it links to the idea of a nation being at threat, the US is right now at threat, like France was at threat, it links to the idea of World War Two, and it really just goes to show the sentiment of the Americans right now. "I ask that the Congress declare that since the unprovoked and dastardly attack by Japan on Sunday, December 7th, 1941," again we review our first marker for dastardly attack in December 7th, "a state of war has existed between the United States and the Japanese Empire."

So now all we have to do is scroll through and review our markers, and we'll get a pretty clear story of what has happened. Let's play the markers back, and let's review what we've seen. Japan attacked. Here's our marker. They did so during peace in the Pacific. By the way, December 7th, 1941, we know that because people were getting ready for Christmas in that first marker. They did so during peace in the Pacific, there was a delay in the message. The distance of the two countries shows pre-planning and deliberate deception by Japan. There was damage to American ships, and American lives lost, again our first marker. They also attacked lots of other countries in Southeast Asia, we know that because of our animated marker here. As Commander in Chief, we will do whatever we need to defend ourselves. There's our marker for defence. Great. We will come out triumphant, even though our territories are at risk right now. We know that, okay, great. But for now, we're at a state of war. Now, we didn't set a marker for state of war, but probably the marker that I would have done during state of war, would have been the, actually, during state of war we have to think that this is a state of war with an Asian country, so probably the marker that I would have come up with, if I hadn't been distracted, would have been the cover of the movie, or the poster of the movie "Full Metal Jacket," because there's a scene when he's in Vietnam, and I know Japan is not in Vietnam, but a state of war during that movie, where his helmet says "war is hell," and I remember him talking about that helmet, and I remember him being questioned by his commanders, so that's my marker for state of war. *So by reviewing all these markers and playing them back, we're able to essentially, really in seconds, it took a long time to explain that after the fact, but in seconds you could review all of those markers, and get so much vivid detail, and you see the interconnections between the markers,* so a lot of our markers reference World War Two, a lot of our markers reference that the Commander in Chief is a president. We have lucky December 7th, and Christmas built into our core marker, and all of this stuff allows you to really understand and really play back and reinforce and review all the key concepts in this text, without having to re-read it, and that is a culmination of what we're trying to do with the super learner method, and what we're trying to get to become natural and second nature.

=== Section 5: Systems For Creating & Maintaining Long Term Memories

*Misconceptions Pre-Quiz III*

#*Using Spaced Repetition To Help Us Maintain Memories*#

Many people may think that becoming a SuperLearner means never having to write things down, because you can rely on your memory to never forget anything. But nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, a big part of being a SuperLearner is in fact storing the information in intelligent ways that we can later review. From different methods of taking notes, to mental exercises for reviewing the materials, to software that can remind us what we've learned, and so much more. This section is going to cover all of that. Starting with the idea of spaced repetition. Over time, if we do not use information that we've learned, our brains do the most efficient thing possible and they start to push it out of our memory. In fact, there's actually a chart that shows the drop-off of memory over time. This is something that Benny Lewis talks about in his TED talk which you may have watched in the supplementary materials. Using dual coding and logical markers as well as learning connected information, and linking our knowledge, we can reduce the forgetting curve and in some cases almost eliminate it. And of course, using new information is perhaps the best way to keep it well-stored in our mind. Maintaining skills or knowledge requires constant work though, and fortunately as long as we deepen our control of the skills, and use these skills periodically, we will not forget the basics. The bottom line is that no matter how good of a job you did encoding your memories, eventually you will probably have to refresh the knowledge and keep it relevant for your brain. There are lots of different ways of doing this, such as telling your friends about it, or disciplining yourself to review periodically. But one of the first and most powerful ways is to use a structured system. In the past, this was done with something called The Leitner System, which is a sophisticated, but rather confusing way, of organising flashcards based on how difficult they are for you to recall and then bringing them back into rotation based on that. It takes a lot of manual work and for that reason it's not something that I recommend. Lucky for us, today there are applications like #*Anki*# that can actually learn how quickly you're forgetting information and based on your rating on how difficult or easy something is, will remind you of the information at scheduled intervals that you're likely to forget it. With powerful software like this, you can easily make notes of pieces of information you wish to remember such as, the key points of a book, the bones in the human wrist, or anything else, and you can rely on Anki to keep you from forgetting it. You can make tens or hundreds of decks for all the types of information you want to review, for example, a deck for each language you want to learn, a deck for all the business books you've read, and a deck for all the names of your spouse's distant relatives, and so much more. Anki can function like your brain's memory maintenance tune-up, where you just stop in every day for 20 minutes to refresh old memories. I can't overstate just how amazing Anki is, because it not only has a version for just about anything with a screen, but it also has a really, really great documentation set where it teaches you about the learning methodology and about how to add cards with pictures, audio, rich text and so much more. They even explain how spaced repetition actually works. They do a really good job of documenting the process of learning with Anki and they even have shared decks that you can download for free, covering just about any topic you'd ever want to learn, especially if those topics include foreign languages, which is something we'll cover in another section. And the best part about Anki is that they have a free synchronisation service that lets you practise anywhere you happen to be. Now, I strongly, strongly recommend Anki because it's a great way to review and it takes the burden out of worrying what you are or are not forgetting over time. I'm going to give you some links to Anki and some powerful tutorials about it in the PDF syllabus, but in general, if you don't use an automatic utility, just know that you'll have to be very disciplined and skim back over the things that you read and learn and use your judgement to determine what you're about to forget. Personally, I've never had the discipline to do this, but maybe you do. In any case, now that we understand spaced repetition, we're going to look at some of the other ways of storing information over the long-term so that we can easily and quickly review it in spaced intervals.

#*Mind Mapping*#

Now that we've talked about note-taking, let's talk about a very sophisticated and powerful way of taking notes that most people fail to use. It's called *mind mapping*, and it was invented by one of the most prominent names in accelerated learning and memory, *Tony Buzan*. *Mind mapping is basically drawing out this neural network of new ideas, concepts, and details in a visual and logical fashion. In the homework, you'll find an article about it with some visual mind maps you can check out yourself, as well as links to some courses that teach mind mapping in a lot of detail*. But, let's try to understand what it is and why it's so powerful. What's great about mind mapping is that it allows us to draw out and visualise neural connexions in the physical realm. And since we already have a built-in system where we're encoding details to get back to the main concept, it's actually very easy for us to translate that into mind maps. Mind maps have a lot of benefits over traditional notes. Not just because they're visual, and allow us to sketch our markers if we want to, but also because they actually show the logical interrelation between different thoughts and ideas. On top of all of this, they're really fast, and they're much easier to read and review than a boring outline structure. *Just imagine that, instead of jotting out notes for a book you read, you instead turn the entire book into one big mind map, noting out the major concepts, or breaking out branches by chapters, or any other structure you can imagine for translating the information into a visual layout*. It doesn't even have to be a visual layout actually, because the technique of mind mapping even applies to imaginary mind maps that you draw up in your mind without ever having to rely on paper. Mind maps are a very personal thing, though, and to get the most out of them you're going to have to play with them and see what the best way for you to create and use them might be. To get you started, though, we'll explain the adapted mind mapping technique developed by Dr. Lev for the super learning methodology over his years of use and refinement. Though it's perhaps just a bit advanced for many students, Dr. Lev actually imagines a mind map as he creates chunks and reviews his markers. It's a powerful way of creating compound markers and preserving the logical flow of the text. First, let's address the issue of complexity. Some of you may have experienced fancy mind mapping applications with beautiful designs and tonnes of visual illustrations. You do not have to do any of that in your head, don't worry about it. You need to keep only the following basics in mind.

*First, the anchor*. The root node, or anchor, is the place from where you access your whole mind map. Whatever imagery you use for the anchor, make it stand out, and make sure it's unforgettable. The anchor is like a personal title you give to an article. You should invest a disproportionate amount of time on it, because it's very, very important. The anchor should summarise the essence of what you need to remember. You can think of it like the trunk of a tree.

*Next are the retrieval markers*. The anchor is connected to the retrieval markers, which are like landing pages for various lines of thought. These markers are created after reading the article, and are used as triggers to remember the root node from as many perspectives as the article supports. Invest a tonne of time into these retrieval markers, or you may forget the whole mind map in a way that only spaced repetition can cure. Think of retrieval markers as the roots of your tree.

*Next are the main branches*. The main branches are allocated for core ideas springing from the trunk. Typically, you have three to six main branches per mind map, which correspond to the sections within an article. The main ideas should come with viable markers. Invest a moderate amount of time here.

*Finally*, we have the smaller branches. The smaller branches are allocated to supporting ideas, controversies, and facts. These are the bulk of your markers, and you should have approximately two per paragraph, subject to the density of the text. Don't invest too, too much time here, after all you are speed-reading, and don't forget that each branch should have a visual representation. Either an icon, or a 3D object, or something like that based on the methodology you're using.

*Ultimately, we also have the leaves*. The leaves are the details and the facts, the numbers, and the specific information that can only be represented by little, tiny leaves. Leaves are typically encoded back as details of the branch that supports them. For example, the colour of the marker, its texture, its shape, or its design. However, if these details are complex, such as names or dates or formulas, they are encoded into separate, yet smaller, branches. All the leaves are typically encoded immediately after reading a paragraph.

*By the way, we also have strings*. Most of us should not only retain what we read, but also generate new thoughts about it. While most of the articles we encounter are built like a tree, the way our stream of thought functions is more like a spider weaving a web between trees to catch elusive bugs of new creative ideas. For this reason, we often connect the small branches and the leaves of various trees with a translucent web of strings that Dr. Lev calls hyperlinks. Hyperlinking is his own addition, so you won't find any hyperlinks in the original mind mapping theory, but in all truth, you cannot operate mind maps effectively without connecting different aspects of the tree. In software, we use pointers and references with a similar effect.

So, when do we use mind mapping? Well, mind mapping is not very useful for memory sports. You can't effectively encode decks of cards or sequences of numbers into a mind map. However, almost any computer programme, textbook, article, or presentation can be effectively encoded as a mind map. Whether you draw it out or visualise it in your mind, mind mapping can be a powerful tool wherever a logical structure is presented. How do you shape and design your mind maps? Dr. Lev is so used to working with data structures, that mind mapping over unique data structure comes naturally for him. The form of mind mapping Anna uses with students, though, is the more classic kind of mind map. She asks you to imagine the face of an analogue clock with numbers one to 12. Now, the trunk, or the bigger branch, always connects where the clock strikes 12. You still have 11 hours to position additional markers or branches. Since each marker is a visual entity, you visualise the clock with the marker near the relevant number, like an icon. It's recommended to put markers on the odd hours, one, three, five, et cetera. Then, use the even hours as a reserve for the markers we need to add later on, like, the results of your analysis, the details you missed during the first read, and so forth. The clock face allows you to remember the exact order of markers, which are drawn clockwise, as well as the relationship between those markers and other details.

So, you might be wondering, can mind mapping be used with other forms of memorization? Absolutely, in fact, it makes sense to make a hybrid between mind maps and other forms of visualisation or memorization. Visualisation, linking memories, and really just about everything we've learned so far about memory all ties in to the concept of mind mapping, and that's why it's so popular. By the way, on one last note, if you're like me, the physical aspect of mind maps is very unappealing to you. And you might also live in a post-paper world. At the same time, you may want to immortalise or share your mind maps in a way that imagining them mentally just doesn't allow. *Not to fear, there's actually a lot of really great software out there for mobile devices and even desktop computers that help you make really beautiful mind maps, and we've included links to some of them in the PDF syllabus.*

*Memory Palaces*

Another very effective tool for storing and remembering information that we super learned is called the *memory palace*. Memory palaces are basically buildings or structures that you create in your mind either imagined or remembered to fill and populate with detail memories. Each story or piece of information is represented by an imaginary physical object, a marker if you will, which is then placed in a specific area whether it'd be on the ground, on a bookshelf, on the counter, on the cupboard, or dangling from the chandelier. These areas, where memories can be stored, are called *loci*. And they've become anchor points. The core of the technique involves using your imagination to walk through this familiar area in a linear fashion, making sure not to cross your own path. As you go through the memory journey, you place objects in memorable areas. Now I used to be very ambivalent about memory palaces and I originally shied away from teaching too much about them. In truth, I was too lazy to invest the time in creating my own memory palaces. And, so I would store my visual markers haphazardly without any order or organisation. However, the more I researched and interacted with experts on memory palaces the more I realised that this technique is actually used by each and every memory athlete without exception. This is for a couple of reasons. Number one, our brains are extremely effective at remembering where things are and visualising them. This is related to those evolutionary skills we talked about earlier. If you remember exactly where the berry tree is in a massive field or exactly where you buried your winter food supply, that can be a huge survival advantage. This is effect is so powerful that I bet if you close your eyes right now you can tell me exactly where the shampoo and conditioner bottles are in your shower. Or where they were in your childhood home from 20 years ago. You probably remember exactly what was in the various rooms and on the various shelves of all of the houses you've ever lived in. You've probably also had that feeling where you listen to a radio programme or had a conversation while passing by a specific intersection or area and then the next time you passed by that area your brain jumps back to the conversation or concept that you were thinking about the last time you were there. All of this is pretty amazing, right? But your brain does it completely naturally. *So, why not use all of that location information, which is just taking up storage space in your brain to link up to new things you want to learn and to make those new memories strongly linked to existing knowledge*.

*Reason number two*. Memory palaces are extremely effective at helping us index events. We can remember events in chronological order, which is really important for things like, memorising, I don't know, speeches? We can even remember things in reverse order if we go through our memory journey backwards. Today I use memory palaces for all kinds of things. In fact, I even used it to memorise the order of points in my TED Talk, and I recently figured out a way to store the Russian grammatical cases using the technique. Memory palaces are so effective that they've been used for thousands of years. Ever since the fifth century BC. The legend goes that the Greek poet, Simonides, was at a banquet hall crowded with people and he left for a few minutes only to find that the whole banquet hall had collapsed. There were no other survivors, and so there was no way to identify the crushed casualties or even to know where they were. In this moment, the memory palace was born and for thousands of years after that until the popularity of the printing press memory palaces where used to memorise huge volumes of information. In fact, researchers have determined that the entire works of Homer, Plato, and even Socrates were probably committed to memory using memory palaces. They were only later written down. So, how do you take advantage of this powerful technique?

image::c://book-mark.png[]

The first step is to create at least one, but probably a few more empty palaces. The palace can be your childhood home, a building once seen, or any building you make up. In fact, most people who use this technique have many different memory palaces for different types of memories. For example, one for your Spanish vocabulary, one for personal information such as birthdays, and credit card numbers, and so on. Once you create the palace, you need to clear off the shelves and make space for new objects. Then, it's time to start practising , placing your markers in strategic areas. Now, I wanna take a quick second to say that memory palaces are not used for everything. For example, it would be extremely difficult to use the memory palace, or loci method, to walk through an imaginary house while we're speed reading. And so we can't use this technique while we read. We just have to link the markers as we go. *Memory palaces are great though for memorising stories, order of events, lists of items, and things like that but only when we have the time to carefully populate and memorise the palace*. So, if you read something for example and want to store the content into a memory palace that's something you should do at the end of the chapter, not while you're reading. There are a lot of amazing, amazing resources involving memory palaces and they go into much more detail than I can in just one short lecture. First, I'm going to refer you to a TED Talk by the former US Memorization Champion, Joshua Foer, where he explains how people are able to memorise 34 decks of playing cards, back-to-back, using memory palaces. Next, I'm going to link you to *Foer's book, Moonwalking with Einstein*, which I strongly recommend as homework for this course. *Finally, I'm going to link you to a Udemy course, a blog, a book, and a podcast by my friend, Dr. Anthony Metivier*. Anthony's a good friend and a fellow Udemy instructor and he's made an entire career out of teaching the Magnetic Memory Method, a system based on creating and adapting memory palaces. He's written a number of books, he's released a number of courses, and he's a very active blogger and podcaster on the subject. It was actually Anthony who convinced me to invest in my own memory palaces and he continues to help me develop this amazing skill as time goes on. These days I use the technique for even the simplest of things. One little hack that I really like is to adapt the technique to my daily meditation. As a beginner in meditation, my brain immediately calls out the things that I need to remember to do, and has some of its best ideas when I'm trying to concentrate on meditation. The standard practise is to observe the thoughts, and to let them pass, which I do, but before I let these strokes of inspiration pass, I make a quick mental marker. For example, if I wanna remember to post a poll on the SuperLearner Facebook group, I create a mental marker of a Facebook voting poll screenshot, and I place it on an imagined bookshelf. This allows me to move on and lets the thought go with ease. By the time I finish my meditation, I may have four or five reminders. I've been amazed by just how well this all works. Even a month later, I remember all of these markers where they are on the bookshelf, even without using the correct technique of walking through the building and what they mean, even though I've already completed most of the tasks. I recently was interviewed by someone who read Joshua Foer's book, and had done the practise exercise of memorising a grocery list. Five years later, he was able to remember over half of the list. Totally amazing. So, your homework is to check out the supplementary materials and memorise your entire to-do list or grocery shopping list using loci and visual markers. Get funky and outrageous with them. You can turn any old boss into a picture of Bowser, the big boss from Mario Bros. sitting at the computer or you can turn wash the car into a picture of two bikini clad beauties sponging your car. Because you've become so skilled at creating detailed and creative markers, it really should be no problem. Don't make the mistake I made for years and stubbornly neglect the memory palace technique. It can make a massive difference in your memory capacity. So, please do check it out.

*Number Memorization Systems*

If you checked out that supplementary TED talk about Advanced Memory, then you already know a bit about what we are going to discuss here. We're going to talk about how you can memorise strings of numbers for the long-term, much longer than the technique you probably use of repeating the phone number over and over until you unlock your phone and enter it into the dialer. What we want to do when we have to memorise large sequences of numbers is unsurprising, we create detailed visual markers for those numbers. It's no different than markers when you read actually. By creating visual markers for numbers, you can transform long strings of numbers into stories and memorise longer strings of information much more permanently than you could otherwise. I'm going to share with you two powerful systems and you can decide which to use based on your needs and how much time and effort you're willing to commit.

The first system is very simple. I can explain to you and you can use it proficiently in just a few minutes. Essentially, what we will do in this method is to build a permanent marker for each number. I'll give you my own system and my own markers but you should think about making your own if they're more emotionally relevant for you than they are for me. Keep in mind, the more ridiculous these markers are just like with any markers, the better it's going to be. So, for the number zero, I use a bagel. For one, I use a pen. For two, I use a broken heart. Three is, of course, a butt from a bird's eye view. Four is a chair. Five is a unicycle. Six is a broken pair of glasses. Seven is a cliff. Eight is racetrack. And nine is a tadpole. From there, you can remember a string of numbers just like this: Eight, six, seven, five, three, zero, nine, becomes a story whereby the racetrack had a broken pair of glasses on it, the driver swerved to avoid them, and he ran off a cliff. The man on the unicycle in the crowd was shocked and he fell on his butt, swallowing the tadpole that he was balancing on his tongue. Now, this is a truly ridiculous story. And so, there's no way that you're going to forget the number eight, six, seven, five, three, zero, nine. But the truth is, it requires us to remember a lot of symbols and that's where the next system comes into play.

It's called The Major Method and while it takes some time and effort to learn, it can be much more effective due to its compressed and condensed nature. Here's how it works. In The Major Method every digit is converted into a *consonant or sound*. Now, I know what you're thinking. Sounds are not the best way to memorise and that's true. But, when you add those sounds up, they actually become a series of words and those words can become pictures. I'll demonstrate in a moment, but first let's define what each of our digits are and what sound they represent. The hardest part of using The Major Method is doing the work upfront to remember which number goes to which consonant. So, as I go through and tell you each one, I'm going to give you a nice little tip to remember it. Zero because it's cero with a C or zero with a Z in most languages, is an S or Z sound. One because it is one long downstroke, is either a T or a D, both of which have only one downstroke in either capital or lowercase. Two, because it looks like a sideways N and because N has two downstrokes is N. Three should be an easy one. It's a sideways M and it's an M here as well. Four looks like a backwards R, so it is an R. Five is a bit tricky. L is the Roman Numeral for fifty and also the top of a 5 is an L. So for five, we replace with L. Six has a J in the top of it. But, nine also has that J. So, that can be a bit tricky. But, six can be any J, SH, or CH sound, including the soft G, je. Seven, well if you look at a K, you'll see that it's made up of two sevens interconnected, so it's a K or a hard C. Now for eight, just think of a V8 engine and you'll remember that it's either an F or a V sound. Nine looks like a lowercase b or p, so it can be either of those. Perhaps most importantly, all vowels sounds as well as W and H, are unassigned. That means that we can add them in and they don't signify anything. One last hack that I'd like to add is that spelling doesn't matter here and repeat letters don't count either. So, a double L, a double R, or a double S, count as just one repetition of that number unless there's a vowel in between. So, that probably didn't mean anything to you. But, you'll understand when you see how The Major Method actually works. Let's say I want to remember that same number as before. Do you remember it? Eight, six, seven, five, three, zero, nine. In The Major Method, we can convert it into a lot of different words or combinations using the sounds. V, F, J, Sh or CH, K, L, M, S or Z, and B or P. Let's see what our options are. Well, we could come up with fish, clam, cup, sip or maybe veggie clumsy pie. Either of these can be easily converted into a marker. I mean just imagine there's something called a clumsy pie which falls off the table any time you try to eat it. It's available in either chicken or vegetarian. There's your marker for a veggie clumsy pie or eight, six, seven, five, three, zero, nine. Seven numbers, one simple and effective marker. It's like built in compression for your brain. Can you think of some other ones for the same phone number? How would you memorise them? Like I said, The Major Method takes a lot of time to learn and to master. Personally, I don't use it very often because I almost never need to memorise numbers longer than ten digits. But if you do, The Major Method is much more efficient and effective, allowing you to use one marker to store many numbers at once without too much mental strain. Play around with each of these methods and see which one best suits your needs.


=== Section 6: Pre-reading and Preparation

*Introducing The SQ3R System*

Now we have a very firm understanding of not only how our various different types of memory work, but also the different criteria we as adult learners need in order to learn effectively. At this point, we're ready to introduce you to something called *SQ3R System*, which is designed to fulfil all of these criteria, and to effectively put the different types of memory on high alert. If you're a previous student of Become a Super Learner, you'll immediately recognise the SQ3R system, though the name might not be familiar to you from the last course. Okay, so what the heck is SQ3R? It sounds like some sort of android robot that spends its time hanging out with Luke Skywalker, doesn't it? But in fact, it's a system used in a lot of US schools. *It stands for survey, question, read, recall, and review.* Each of these steps is a critical part of the super learner process. At least when the information we're trying to super learn is written text. For this reason, we've devoted an entire section to pre-reading alone. In the lectures that follow, *you'll learn why pre-reading is a speed-reader's hidden weapon, and how to utilise this skill to enhance curiosity and focus, to improve reading speed, and to boost overall retention*. For now, though, here's a summary of what happens during each of these steps.

During the *survey step*, which we also call pre-reading, we skim or scan the content before we read it to prepare our mind for the new information. This is thoroughly covered in the coming lectures.

In the *question phase*, we ask ourselves questions to improve our motivation, such as why we're trying to read and what's in it for us. Clear motivation improves the reading process, and getting to the content from different perspectives improves our understanding.

Next, we *read*. Either speed-reading, or in the normal fashion. When reading, you maximise the benefit of the previous S and Q steps, so you don't have to reread, or dwell on irrelevant details. *Then, we recall*. We add details to the markers after reading each paragraph. This is our way to ensure we recall the paragraph. During our speed-reading training, we will have to read and recall a text several times until we get 100% retention. And only after several weeks will we really trust the brain to recall automatically. *Finally, we review*. We analyse the content from multiple perspectives, and we see what we learned and then we try to connect it to previous knowledge. The fastest readers, like Dr. Lev, will spend more time on this step than on all the previous steps taken together. That's because if you do not review the article properly, it's hard to understand it, and occasionally you will need to revisit it over and over. So, now that we understand the SQ3R Model, let's learn how to optimise it starting out with surveying, or as we call it, pre-reading.

*Pre-read Before You Read*

Now that you understand the SQ3R methodology, it's time to dive right in with your speed-reading training. Starting from the top, S for survey. If you look up the definition of survey in the dictionary, you will see a number of definitions. To survey something means to investigate, examine, question and record information about it. This, in short, is a summary of all the activities we're conducting in our minds during the initial process of speed-reading, pre-reading. Now, pre-reading may seem counter-intuitive since increasing our speed is one of the intentions of the course, *but actually pre-reading helps us speed up while priming our brain for reading the text with high retention. This is especially important for dense materials or mixed reading with lots of pictures, such as textbooks.** Now, I probably wouldn't pre-read a novel for fear of spoiling the plot, but if I do, I'll look for areas of conversation and dialogue and I'll determine the outline and flow of the chapter. Now, when we pre-read a non-fiction kind of text, we're taking a few seconds per page at a speed of about five to eight times our current reading speed. We're not reading the text or even trying to. *Instead, we're just looking for titles, sub-headings, proper nouns, numbers, words or things that just don't seem to fit in. When we pre-read we gain an understanding of the structure of the text and we build a sort of "mental map." We start to generate thoughts and ideas about the text and we think to ourselves,* "oh, that's interesting, they're going to talk about Buzz Aldrin here," for example. These points of curiosity will serve as temporary markers, for now and we'll be able to upgrade them later with much more detailed, high-quality markers when we actually read the text. The Pareto principle or the 80/20 rule is very helpful here. You see, the Pareto principle says that "80% of something yields 20% of it's benefit and vice versa." So for example, 80% of your friends give you 20% of the love and support that you get while the top 20% give you 80%. This rule can be applied to nearly anything, from economics to business to personal relationships and it can definitely be applied here. You see, in pre-reading, we're looking for those 20% of details that give us an 80% understanding of at least what we're going to be reading, at least what the text is about. In the long-term, once you become skilled enough at creating markers, you'll be able to spot and store high-quality markers even in your pre-reading. This means that when you actually read the text, all you have to do is fill in those two to four detail markers we talked about for each marker and you're well on your way. This will take a lot of time, but it's a pivotal skill in speed-reading and it'll differentiate skimming from actually learning the content you're reading at a high level. It's important to note that even though you don't register the text, you are building a map of it and becoming more familiar with it sub-consciously. Just like you begin to understand the layout of a neighbourhood, even if you drive through it at 40 miles an hour. *Don't get frustrated and don't get hung up on understanding the text itself. Just understand the flow and any interesting points of information that might jump out at you. This alone is a major benefit of pre-reading but as we're about to see, it's not the only one.*

*Creating Burning Interest: Perspectives, Prior Knowledge, & W/H Questions*

Now, it's time to remind ourselves of our dear friend, *Malcolm Knowles* and what he had to say, about adult andragogy. As I'm sure you remember, Dr. Knowles taught us that adult learners require not only a learning environment that harnesses their previous experiences but also the appropriate readiness, a pressing need and an immediate application of the knowledge they wish to acquire. Basically, adult learners need to be curious about what they're learning and connect it to their existing knowledge. Now, in a perfect world, you would only have to learn things that were deeply interesting and inspiring to you. But sadly, that's not the way the world currently works. Often times, we have to learn a lot of topics that we simply don't find interesting and even if the topic itself is interesting, they're a lot of elements or reading materials surrounding it that just aren't our cup of tea. Personally, I remember whining to one of my closest friends during college because I'd recently changed my major to a topic that was much more interesting to me, only to find that at least half of the articles in the introductory classes, were just as boring as the ones in my previous major. To get around this, you should use your pre-reading time to inspire within yourself a burning curiosity or interest in what the text is about, and you should think about how you should apply it. *If done properly, even the most uninteresting material such as tax law, can benefit from this practise*. Let's talk about some different ways we can actually do this. 

*Technique number* one is to envision yourself using the material. As you read throughout the text, you should try to envision scenarios in which it could affect your life or how you could actually benefit from having that knowledge. How would you use the knowledge in your day-to-day life? Of course, as we mentioned before, try to connect any markers you develop to existing knowledge or experiences in your long-term memory. 

Technique *number two*, start asking questions. By developing your own questions and curiosities within the text, you're going to see a huge improvement in both reading and comprehension. Perhaps for example, you see that the text mentions Baltimore, Maryland. Ask yourself, what the heck does Baltimore have to do with real estate law? What happened there? Was there maybe a precedent set? This trick alone is going to make you very motivated to read through the text and figure out, just what the heck is going on. Furthermore, you should find things that don't seem to fit in and ask yourself, what they're doing there. 

*Technique number three*, consider different perspectives. When I was struggling with pre-reading, Dr. Lev gave me a tip that has stuck with me to this day. He told me to ask myself questions involving perspectives, mine, the authors, even third parties. Though I'm not yet reading the text itself, I'm seeing the keywords and those keywords are enough to generate some pretty opinion laden questions. These include, what viewpoint do I anticipate the author taking? What viewpoint do I have going into reading this article? Where might the author be wrong? Where am I open to being persuaded on this topic? How could this material be improved? What would critics of this article likely say? Who are some people I know who might agree or disagree with what this article likely says? What would I expect to see in this text that I am not seeing at this speed? 

Now, you might wonder how I could generate all of these questions without ever actually reading the chapter, but in fact, it's pretty easy. Let's say for example, you were reading an article about nutrition. Just by seeing which keywords, like Paleo or grains, or animal protein, cancer, obesity or insulin. If I see that those words are being used, I can already tell a lot and just by seeing which studies and which experts are being cited, I can tell even more. So, before I ever actually read the article, I probably already know what stance the author is likely going to take and based on that, I definitely know whether I agree or disagree. I may think of a few of my vegetarian or vegan friends at the same time and consider whether or not they'll turn blue in the face or love every word. I'll even consider where I feel the author maybe biassed, misinformed or just plain wrong. As you can see, by the time you actually dive into reading the article at your normal speed, whatever that is, you'll have a lot of questions that you're very eager to answer. And, this is a huge tool for concentration, comprehension and retention. If you suffer from attention deficit disorder, you know that if you really want to know something, you can be laser focused and after generating all of these perspectives and questions, you will be, just that. If you really want to know why the heck Baltimore is in this text. You'll come back and you'll focus harder than you ever imagined you could focus on tax law. As you can imagine, there's a little bit of homework for this section. *I want you to incorporate pre-reading, generating questions, imagining multiple perspectives, and curiosity, into the things that you're normally reading*. If you're a student, this means that you pick the most boring text from that econ class and you try to pre-read it. If you're at work, try doing the same. I want you to work on building that skill set, that allows you to generate intense curiosity out of thin air. I want you to use your creativity skills to imagine multiple perspectives and even generate ideas as to how you could use the text in your day-to-day life. Perhaps it doesn't seem like it would make a big difference, but trust me, it does.

*Demonstration: Pre-reading*

Now that we understand the importance of pre-reading for generating interest and curiosity and also getting our first basic markers that we'll be filling in with detail later. I wanna take you guys really quickly just through the process of pre-reading with the super learner book and the first step you wanna do when you pre-read, is if you have a paper book, you're just gonna flip through it really quickly, if you have a digital book, you kinda gonna do the same thing and I'm not really picking up anything in this first phase, except for, what are the words that repeat themselves, and what's the format of the book. Obviously, I'm gonna realise really quickly in here that the word super learner or super learning repeats. The word, memory, the word, brain, even at this speed, you can probably see that these are words that just repeat over and over, so those are not gonna be good things to pay attention to because I'm gonna get confused if I pay attention to those words since they appear over and over and over. I mean look how many times memory is on this page. Okay, so now if we go back, and that was already all the way through to page 70, so it gives you an idea just how fast we're doing that. If we go back, let's go ahead and read the forward of this book, and we're gonna pre-read it. We get to the foreword, what are the first things we notice and I just wanna emphasise that this explanation is gonna be about one 1/100th of the speed that you're gonna be doing this actual pre=reading at. Obviously we notice, foreword, we're not gonna notice super learner, because that appears over and over now, you might be the type of person who notices numbers, I know Doctor Left doesn't. But, for me, 2008 is interesting and I immediately start getting these WH questions. What happened in 2008, why did it happen so long ago? I immediately go to Chicago, okay, that's interesting, what's happening in Chicago. I think I see recession, okay that's interesting, what does a recession have to do with super learning. Quality job, okay, that's interesting. I wonder what a quality job is to this person, I even wonder who this person is. Things are all coming into my head in real time, but I want to methodically explain them to you. Let's see, we keep going, okay, here we have, brain, we ignore that one, that's not a word that means anything here, because it repeats so much. On the couch reading, I definitely see that, neurological diseases, okay, that's interesting, what does this person care about neurological diseases. Alzheimer's, okay, interesting. You'll see that I'm kinda zig-zagging through. Kim Peek, okay that's very interesting because I know who Kim Peek is. So, he's already a marker for me, I have an image of him already that I'm gonna connect. I wanna ask myself, what does this author have to say about Kim Peek? Does he think that he's really smart, does he think he's not smart, Rainman, that makes sense, because Kim Peek was the character that the movie was based on. Awesome. Rudiger Gamm, ooh, I don't know who that is, is that someone like Kim Peek? Is it the guy who researched Kim Peek? At the speed that I would be pre-reading this, I would only pick up Rudiger Gamm, so who is that, why is he in here. Ben Pridmore, that's interesting, that's another guy, why is he in here, what does he have to do with Kim Peek. Memorising a deck of cards comes up to me and 24.74 seconds now, again, just to hit pause, the types of questions that come up to me are, what happened in 24.74 seconds, maybe it's some feed of memory, maybe that's how fast he can read a page of a book. Really interesting, it starts generating questions to me and I'm gonna want to come back. I already have a marker of a stopwatch right there, and I'm gonna remember, I wanna come back and I want to pay special attention here to figure out what happened in just 24.74 seconds. Okay, continuing, fascinating, that doesn't tell me anything. Ordinary people, that's interesting, okay, are we now gonna compare Kim Peek to ordinary people? What does ordinary people have to do with these superheroes who can do these amazing things. Okay, poor memory, that's interesting. Seems like we just changed gears. Why did we change gears, why did we do this complete about phase. Grandmother, that's interesting. You know you can already start to get this curiosity. If you're not reading as I go along in the video, you're probably wondering what the heck all these words have to do with one another. Increasingly failing memory, alright, that's interesting. Now how are we gonna compare these world record holder, you know, savants, these autistic savants, as it shows in the top of the page. How are they gonna be compared? Alright, let's keep going. Let's see, out of date, alright, that's interesting. Up here we go, frustrating, yeah, alright. What's frustrating, what was frustrating to the author? Alright, super learning, we don't notice, although I do think it's interesting that super learning is capitalised here. I wonder why it's capitalised here. Alright, what else? Digestible, that's interesting. For me, it's kind of weird that the word, digestible, is related to memory. Alright, we keep going. Grandmother passes, pick that up immediately. Miami, okay, that's interesting, we were in Chicago, now we're in Miami. So you can already ask yourself why, you can keep going, winning the championship. I see championship, that's interesting, I wonder what that championship is in, I wonder what this person has to do with the championship, 2010 and 2014, changed the way I live my life. Probably wouldn't see that whole thing. Alright, so already we have some really good curiosity and then, immediately I jump to Nelson Dallas, four time USA Memory Champion. That's interesting, there's a lot of questions that I've already generated over this pre-reading and even though I would probably do this in about four or five, maybe maximum, 10 seconds, you can see that we have so many questions. So we're gonna read this with such an intent interest and we even have markers. You guys remember what are markers are? Well, we have Chicago, we have Kim Peek, we have neurological diseases and we can already start populating those things, those markers with the tail when we read. The idea behind pre-reading is that you do this in large sections, so normally, you wouldn't just pre-read three pages, you might read 10 or 20 and then you'll really have a bunch of curiosity that will take you all the way through the chapter.

=== Section 7: Read With You Eyes, Not With Your Inner Voice

*How To Properly Test Your Comprehension Without Fooling*

I hope you're excited because we've finally arrived at the skill that's going to put everything we've learned so far to good use. Taking your overall learning skills to the next level. That's right, we're ready to start speed-reading. Now, with that said, we need to ensure that as we transition into speed-readers, we don't forget our fundamentals. *Though a big part of the speed-reading learning curve will mean that you don't have high comprehension in the short-term, we do want to make sure that you're keeping comprehension and retention at high levels over the long run*. This is a bit difficult though, because it's surprisingly easy to fool yourself into thinking that you remember everything. When you go back thought the text later on to test yourself, or when you take a quiz, you'll often tell yourself, "yeah, yeah, yeah, I remember this stuff." But oftentimes the brain is tricking us. It's mistaking familiarity with actual retention, because when you see a piece of information it somewhat jogs your memory. This is called confirmation bias and it's something we want to avoid if we're going to accurately measure our comprehension and retention. *So here's an exercise that we recommend for periodically testing yourself and your comprehension. After pre-reading and speed-reading a section of text, take a moment to jot down everything you remember on paper or a text document and then compare your notes side-by-side with the text that you read*. This is a powerful exercise, not only because it will keep you honest and shut down your confirmation bias, but also because you can learn a lot from the details you neglected or remembered incorrectly. By doing this, you can determine if, for example you need to pay a little more attention to names or dates or anything else. Anytime you miss a pertinent detail or concept, you should ask yourself why it happened. Is it in the very beginning or in the end of the text where you might've been eager to start or finish and you lost focus? Do you have a bias towards certain types of information? Do you think that there were too many details in the text? With that said, you need to use your judgement here. Sometimes a bias towards a specific type of information is a good thing. If you're reading a technical manual and you're biassed towards the technical specifications over the less useful descriptive information, that's fine and in fact it's preferable. Essentially, we don't expect you to regurgitate the text 100% word-for-word. We do however, expect that with time, you'll be able to identify and recall every detail, concept and idea that you deem pertinent. Not all details are pertinent though, and you should be able to differentiate which information is throw away and which information should be remembered. What if you added information that wasn't there to begin with? Well, first and foremost, ask yourself why. Perhaps you're trying to analyse the text while reading instead of during the pauses at the end of each paragraph or section instead. There's no specific homework for this exercise or for some of the other speed-reading skills we'll be teaching you, instead you should work this exercise and the others we'll share into your normal training throughout the course of the coming weeks. You don't need to quiz yourself every time you read, but you should try to do this exercise as often as possible. It'll greatly improve your retention not just of the text you're practising on, but also of everything you read as you become more and more aware of your weak spots over time and you use that knowledge to overcome them.

*How Most People Read: Subvocalization*

So we've finally arrived at what you might think is the sexiest part of the course, *the speed reading*. Well, first things first, I'd like to clarify a few misconceptions about speed reading and set your expectations. You see, when I first started teaching these courses, I, too, thought that speed reading was the sexy part of the whole methodology. But I was wrong. In fact, over the last five years, working with over 150000 students, I've come to realize that the real magic of the super learner methodology is in the memory techniques. *I've seen the transformation that 10x someone's memory can make in their lives almost overnight*. And compared to that, reading two to three times faster is a parlor trick. So before we dive too deep, I want to really set your expectations and clarify a few things that have confused students over the years. 

*First off, whereas the mnemonic techniques that you learned in the beginning of the course are a radical renovation of the entire way your brain works speed reading, on the other hand, is a tool*. Now, what do I mean by this? Well, throughout the course, I am very explicit about the fact that I want you to use mnemonic techniques such as visual markers for just about everything in life. 

This leads me to *point number two*. Speed reading will probably never be as comfortable or natural as the slow way of reading because you've likely been reading the slow way for 20 or more years by the time you get to this course. That's a really tough habit to break. There are two metaphors that I like to give students that explain this. The first is handstands and handstand walks. You see, though, I've been trained to stand on my hands and even to walk comfortably on my hands. The fact is, when I got out of bed in the morning, it is most comfortable by far and most natural for me to walk on my feet to the bathroom. *This means that I need to constantly remind myself to use good speed reading habits when appropriate, if I want to avoid those bad, slow reading habits*. Now, this is where the second metaphor comes in slouching. Even though we all know that we should be sitting up straight in our chairs. I bet that 90 percent of you are slouching and just sat up straight after I reminded you. *You see, even though we know better, sometimes it takes a continuous and conscious effort to do what we know is a better option. For me, this is the same with speed reading. If I sit down with a book mindlessly and I don't make a conscientious effort to speed read, I will default to bad habits*. Even five years after my training with Anna, maybe after 20 years of speed reading, it'll come naturally to me. But for now I need to consciously remind myself to speed read when it's appropriate. The next clarification point I want to make is this. In this course, we do not teach the hyped up type of speed. Reading that science doesn't support students often send me one of a few different articles or research papers disproving speed reading. Now, generally speaking, they are surprised when I enthusiastically agree with what the researchers have found. This is because most studies on speed reading are disproving speeds of 1000 to 5000 words per minute, which we would never claim. In doing so, the research generally finds that comprehension begins to dip at around 600 words per minute and begins to take a drastic drop at 750 to 800 words per minute. *Now, it's no coincidence that we claim to triple the average person's reading speed. This would bring you right into the range that is supported by various research studies*. For more information on that, you can check out a video that we recently released on our YouTube channel, which actually analyzes the research on speed reading in depth. *And finally, one last point of clarification before we dive in. Learning speed reading with high comprehension is challenging, whereas the improvements to your memory may have been quick and easy for many of you. Once you understood how visual markers and memory palaces work, the sad truth is that relearning how to read with high comprehension can easily take a few months, if not more, and you can fall out of shape if you don't maintain the skill regularly*. In this way, the metaphor of walking on your hands is even more apt. It takes time to learn and it's a skill that you need to maintain if you want to be proficient. 

All right. Now that we have set our expectations, let's learn how to speed read, shall we? 

*First off*, let's start by understanding how most people like me before I took a.. Course and probably like yourself as well. Read when most people read, they actually hear one hundred percent of the words in their mental voice. This is a process called *sub. Vocalisation* and they go along the text and hear the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. This is because when we are taught to read, we have to sound it out. We don't know how words look visually. And so we well, sound it out f o x fox. This is a very hard habit to break because it's how we learned and it's how we've read for at least ten or 20 years, like I said before. And so we associate the words we see not with the meaning or context directly, but with the sounds they make in our mind, and then we translate those sounds into meaning or content. *Now, it's important to note that the research shows us that completely eliminating some vocalization is pretty much impossible. Our minds will always sound out a percentage of the words we read, and there's not much that we can do about that. But as we've learned already, transmitting data to the brain via auditory processing is hugely inefficient by cell vocalizing. Every single word you read,you're effectively taking high quality visual information and symbols in the forms of written words, and you're degrading the quality or bandwidth. If you think about it, it's sort of like trying to describe a picture to your friend over the phone rather than just showing them the pictures so they can see it for themselves*. The maximum speed that you can attain by sub vocalizing every word is about 250 words a minute. If you're really, really fast, you can maybe sub vocalize at 400 words per minute. Speed reading, however, starts at about 450 words per minute, roughly double the rate of an average reader. *And since I know you're wondering, nearly all of you taking this class can at least break six hundred words per minute in your native language*. This may sound incredible at first. You may doubt yourself or doubt that your brain can do all this. If that's the case, let me ask you this. Have you ever had a great idea pop into your head and instantaneously you understand the idea in its entirety before your mind even has the opportunity to try and form words around it? I mean, think about the fact that the symbol for a new idea is a light bulb, most likely because a new idea hits you at the speed of light and it's instantly formed in your head in a fraction of the time it would take for you to describe it verbally. Or how about this, have you ever stepped out into the road and noticed that a car or motorcycle or even bike is approaching you and you've reacted with lightning speed? In that type of scenario, your brain was able to not only assess the speed and trajectory of the incoming threat, but also to weigh all of your options, make a decision and communicate to your body the best course of action. All of this happens without any form of self vocalization of your thought process every single day. Your brain does all of this in fractions of a second every time you are about to drop something on your toe and every time you see a familiar face in a crowd, *your brain can perform these incredibly complex functions in literally fractions of a second*. In fact, neuroscientists have recently discovered that even though it takes a bit longer to process, your brain requires only 13 milliseconds to recognize an image that's zero point zero one three seconds. And you're worried about understanding a bunch of visual symbols on a page a little faster nonsense. *Beyond all this, when you lean on some vocalization during reading, you'll be much more easily distracted and you'll have lower comprehension and retention*. After all, we've all had the experience of reading through a text only to have our focus drift off without us even noticing only paragraphs or even full pages later do we realize that we haven't even been listening to our own self vocalised reading in speed reading. However, we learn to read much quicker than the so-called sound barrier of self vocalization. While this means that speed reading is much more taxing on our mental faculties, it also means that we use a more efficient process for absorbing the visual information. We minimize that inner voice and instead we start to recognize words for what they are visual symbols. *We also break apart the three processes of memory encoding, storage and retrieval*. You may remember that we explained this with the metaphor of washing one shirt at a time. Here's a quick overview of how we're going to learn to read differently.

*First*, we're going to absorb the information and encoded using rapid efficient versions of something called the caves and fixations from there will train our minds to quickly and automatic. Store information into our short term memory and to prime it for our long term memory using emotionally significant markers or reference points, we've covered that already. *Finally*, we take periodic pauses at the end of pages or chapters like we mentioned before, and we perform retrieval, retrieval or playing back the markers and reviewing them convinces the hippocampi to move the most detailed information possible into the long term memory and to maintain it while it's there. *By breaking this process apart into three separate steps, our entire learning and reading process becomes both more efficient and more effective*. As you can imagine, there are a number of steps we need to follow in order to perform this somewhat delicate untangling of the three steps. And in the next lecture's, we'll show you how.

*Saccades: Using Your Eyes As Effectively As Possible*

*The first thing we do when we actually sit down to speed reading is imagine two or three separate columns on the page, and we train our eyes to jump between those columns.* As it turns out, our eyes are actually incapable of making smooth, gradual movements unless they are tracking a moving object. So, if we are moving our visual focus from one thing to another, for example, from one word on a page to the one next to it, our eyes have to make very sharp, precise jumps. And these jumps are called saccades. When you dart your eyes across the room because you see something in your peripheral vision, you are able to move quickly and refocus very quickly. That's a *saccade*. And the points that your eyes end up on, where they focus and allow the brain to figure out what it's seeing, those are called *fixations*. 

*In general, average readers do 10 to 20 small saccades per line of text. This means that they are actually making one saccade and one fixation for every word. As you can imagine, this is hugely inefficient, because all the time your eyes spend moving is time that they are not sending information to the brain*. At least not information that it can use. If you don't believe me, put your hands out in front of you, about two hands width apart. Focus on one hand, and then jump over to the other. Do this again and again, and try to notice what's happening while your eyes are in motion. If you do it enough times, you will realise that your brain is essentially stitching the images together from when you are fixated on either hand to provide an uninterrupted image. But it's not really focusing on taking in any information while your eyes are in motion. This effect is called *saccadic masking* or is often called saccadic blindness. To avoid the inefficiencies of becoming effectively blind during saccadic masking, speed-readers minimise the number of fixations per line to between two and three in a normal book or four to five in a full-width webpage. This means making only one or two saccades per line on an average paperback book, or three to four on a full-width webpage. The goal is to learn to do this as quickly and effectively as possible, no matter what format our reading material comes in. Of course, we should try to format the text into an appropriate width, for two to three fixations, if we have an option. We'll cover e-readers, browser extensions, and stuff like that later, but when formatting the text isn't possible, we try to think in advance, during our pre-reading, how many saccades will be necessary to efficiently cover the page. And in time, we'll learn how to expand the width of our fixations in order to minimise the number of saccades we need to make. For example, in a small printed newspaper column, or on an electronic device such a cellphone, one fixation is usually enough, meaning that you can focus on the middle of the screen and simply scroll downwards with your eyes. This one trick of jumping in saccades and creating larger fixations is pretty much the gist of what most speed reading classes teach in their two-hour seminars. It's summarises everything that Tim Ferriss preaches in the PX Method article, and it's the basis for all speed reading. But what's missing in Tim's method is not only the memory skills to ensure high retention, but also the process of optimising the saccades to reach much higher speeds than even he can claim. So, let's jump in and see how we can get past that 450 words per minute with 20% comprehension roadblock. As we go along, make sure to check the PDF syllabus, as the number of games and exercises you are going to need to practise and play every day is going to start picking up. And we'll be offering you a lot of games that will help you master this crucial skill.

*Improving Your Eye Span: Wider Saccades*

One of the best ways to exceed the 450 word per minute limit of those "other" speed reading programmes, is to improve your focal eye span. As it turns out, we can train the eye to have a wider fixation, even if only by a little bit and to catch more words on the periphery of our fixations. The main way of doing this, is to use something called, *Schultz Tables*. Schultz Tables show you a table of number and they ask you to focus on the centre number, while trying to determine what the numbers next to it are. Over time, you practise by going out further and further into the periphery and eventually, you should see a dramatic improvement in your peripheral vision. That's why these exercises are a big part of your homework in the coming weeks. 

Now, when Anna told me to practise these games, I didn't pay attention and I really wish I had, because if you improve your eye span, even minimally, you'll see that you have to make fewer saccades on the average page, and you have better coverage and overlap on the fixations that you do make. Even if you're only able to cut one saccade out, it's going to dramatically increase your reading speed. *Most of you will start with fixations of only three words, but the best speed readers can reach up to 12 words in one fixation*. An entire line and they're able to completely eliminate the need for horizontal saccades. They simply make vertical saccades, reading one entire line at a time. It's an incredible thing to see. *If you have any aspirations of breaking a thousand word per minute, you'll need to dramatically improve the width of your fixations, in order to minimise the number of saccades you need to make on a page*. So, put in the time, push yourself, challenge your peripheral vision and make sure you're playing the seemingly silly games referred to you, on the PDF syllabus.
