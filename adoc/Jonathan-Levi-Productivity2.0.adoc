*About Your Instructor: How This Course Came To Be*

Hi there, my name is Jonathan Levy. I'm an entrepreneur, best selling author, award winning podcast and creator of some of the Web's top courses on accelerated learning, memory and life hacking. I'm also a die hard productivity geek. In fact, from an early age, my parents taught me that it was better to work smart than to work hard. And since then, I've been passionate about getting the most out of my time and my energy. But it wasn't until my late teenage years when I needed it most, that I really began to study productivity and life hacking with any seriousness. You see, at the age of 16, I founded an e-commerce company selling luxury goods. Now that business grew much faster than I ever imagined, and by the time I started university at UC Berkeley, I was running a two million dollar business all in my spare time. Now, given that I wanted to be an active member of my fraternity, I have a healthy relationship with my girlfriend and still have time to relax. And on top of all that, maintain an average. Despite growing up with learning disabilities, I had to learn time management and productivity hacks fast. During this time, I was heavily influenced by a lot of different people, from my parents to university professors to mentors and of course, the works of Tim Ferriss, a legendary productivity hacker and in my opinion, a total genius. The productivity hacks, I learned, enabled me to grow my business to X year over a year during my entire four year career at Berkeley, while maintaining a three point nine GPA average, a great social life and tons of hobbies later on. These same techniques would help me serve as president of a non-profit, all while running my own company and to other side businesses. Fast forward a few years and I found myself in a venture capital office preparing to go to business school. After having sold my company, I was about to start a very intensive one year condensed program and I wanted to make sure I had time to learn all the material as well as network, party and travel throughout Europe and Southeast Asia. I needed even more strategies for maximizing my time and effort, and it was just my luck that I met an expert in speed, reading and memory. Now I tell that story in my best selling course, become a super learner and so I won't go into it too much here. However, it's important to note that *I left for business school with an incredible ability to read as fast as 800 words per minute with up to 80 or 90 percent retention*. While this obviously helped me manage the academic load in record time. It also gave me a pretty great new ability. *I could synthesize and digest huge amounts of information really quickly*. Now, since I've always been interested in life hacking and getting more out of life, you can imagine that these are the first subjects I dove into. After the stress of business school was behind me, I read a 660 page anthology of body language to learn how to hack the elusive concept of charisma, enabling me to stand in front of you right now and lecture without being completely awkward. *I read Kelly Starret bookshelf breaking book Becoming a Supple Leopard on Hacking and Fixing Your Body to Alleviate Chronic Pain. And of course, I read Tim Ferriss is Awesome Biohacking book The Four Hour Body*. I also devoured literally thousands of articles on everything from sleep to computer productivity hacks to cutting edge technology hacks and even more. I've done all kinds of crazy tests and experiments on myself, and I love to share the benefits of my learnings with others. Today, I lead a pretty efficient life, though I've been able to build another seven figure business. The truth is, I don't work too much and generally speaking, I don't stress too much. I hardly waste any time on menial tasks. I run a few side businesses, work on a lot of different projects, learn languages in my spare time and travel about one out of every six weeks. I do all of this while maintaining a rich social life, a healthy and loving relationship, and an active exercise and fitness regimen. In short, I have the capacity to make a lot of free time for the things that I think are worthwhile. In fact, this has become so apparent to people that meet me that a lot of my conversations invariably become lectures on how to shave time off the unimportant activities in life to make more time. And so that's what originally brought me to creating this course, become a speed demon. You see, in this course, my goal is to impart to you all the skills, strategies, techniques and tips that I've accumulated for making your life as productive and happy as possible. I'm going to show you how I automate the majority of the grudge work and how I speed up everything from exercise to interactions, ultimately my goal for you is to overcome that feeling of overwhelm, you know, the one the feeling where you never have enough time to do the things you want. And now in the interest of saving time, since that's what we're all about in this course. Let's go ahead and get right to it, shall we?

*Course Structure & How To Succeed*

I know you're eager to get started, and, of course, I want to be respectful and considerate of your time. So this is just a quick lecture to explain to you how we're going to break apart the course and structure it in the next section. General principles for hacking your productivity. We're going to learn the overall strategies and theories around improving productivity. Now, these general tips and tricks apply to every aspect of your life, not just the specific areas we are going to focus on in the course. It's important to invest in the right mindset and skill set up front in order to build the proper foundation for these subsequent productivity hacks. You should view the theories and strategies in Section two as ways of thinking, ways of looking at your work and different mental hacks to improve your productivity, efficiency and efficacy in any task you pursue in each of the next four sections, we are going to tackle an area of life where people typically spend a lot of their time at the time of recording. These sections include. *Speeding up and automating computer work, speeding up health and fitness, automating your finances and delegation and saying no*. By the way, we welcome your requests and suggestions for other sections we can add and improve as time goes on in each of these overarching sections. We're going to check out a few strategies, tools, tricks and tips that we can use to either speed up or automate some of the time consuming tasks in that area. Now, some areas lend themselves more easily to improvements and therefore there will be more resources for, say, something like computer work. Then there will be four sleep, which is a pretty fundamental biological need. Anyways, if you're taking this course, it's safe to assume that you're suffering from a lack of free time, thus in the interest of time and efficiency. My goal is not to teach you everything that there is to know about every single individual topic or subject during the lectures. Instead, I will give you an introduction, a functional explanation, and I'll help you understand where the concept or practice fits in to the bigger picture. Then I'll provide some carefully curated supplementary materials, which you should read and digest as homework. I expect that you as a diligent student, will seek out further learning on topics that you find interesting. This coincides with my background in accelerated learning, as I know that only if you make the material your own and interact with it and dig into the topics that you are interested in on your own time, will you really internalize it? So while we may go quickly, there is a reason now, a note on the computer stuff. By the way, for most demonstrations, I will be using a Mac iPhone or iPad. But don't worry, I will also give links and explanations and examples and sometimes even screenshots for Windows, Android or even Linux. Additionally, we intend to continuously add to this course both in subjects and in other resources. So if something is missing or you have a better recommendation, just submit a question and we will address it. We're also going to be giving you lots of quizzes which will help reinforce the material you're learning. One thing that's different about my courses from other peoples is that I give you pre quizzes before each content section which test you on things you haven't even learned yet. Why? Again, this relates to the requirements of adult learning. My goal is not just to set a baseline of what you know before taking the course, but also to get you thinking and generate some curiosity about the topics you're going to learn. This will make sure that I don't lose your attention and it'll give you a great sense of satisfaction when the post test is so much more successful than the pre-test. So don't fret if you don't get all the answers wrong on a pre quiz anyways. The grades don't matter on the Internet. Last but not least, I want to say that not every hack is for everyone. Some people enjoy the process of leisurely walking to work for 30 minutes when they could just as easily ride a bike in five. I understand that. And so it's up to you to pick and choose what is helpful to you and what isn't. And so without any further ado and thanks for your patience, let's dive in to our first section, which deals with the overall principles of speeding up and hacking productivity. This will give us the right mental frameworks and understandings to apply all the subsequent tricks, tips and hacks.
