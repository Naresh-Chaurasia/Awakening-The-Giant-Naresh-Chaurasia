=== Section 1: Course Purpose & Structure (Housekeeping Section)

==== Expectations: What you can expect to achieve through completing this course

So this is a quick run through of the sort of mind maps that you will be able to create as a consequence of completing this course. You'll learn to do quick sketch black and white mind map. Few examples here. They don't need to be perfect they're just mapping out very quickly in black and white things that we. We wish to remember but we'll also learn the effective use of color for mind mapping. And here are some examples that *color on a mind map. There's not there just to beautify. In fact their main function is to help the important concepts stand out from the background*. That's a mind map there of a summary of a book. And this is a mind map of a holiday. Now we can make quick mind maps and you'll be to make quick mind maps for summarizing books or articles and for making notes and you can do these with or without color. Here's one that's a summary of a university course on managing projects in simple black and white. And here are a couple of TED talks that have been very simply mapped out using the mind mapping technique. *Importantly you'll also learn how and why certain diagrams are not mind maps because they disregard certain important principles*. So here some none of these are mind maps although people on the Internet will often describe them as mind maps. They disregard certain of the principles so cannot really be called mind maps and they're certainly not as effective as a proper mind map. And finally to help you achieve success as a mind mapper Well there's lots of practice activities throughout the course designed to help you step by step. develop all the essential skills that your require and you can ask for personalized feedback on the mind maps you create as a result of taking this course and you can ask questions at any time and expect a response from me usually within 48 hours and most responses are within eight hours.

==== The Course Purpose

Let's have a quick look at the purpose of this course. The primary purpose is to teach you mind mapping. Not only that to do mind mapping effectively in order to do that. We include in this course a couple of additional things. *One is we will be showing you that when it comes to learning remembering more is actually done by using less. So on the course we'll be learning how you can use less information to retain and recall more information a bit of a paradox*

on the course we'll be showing you the power of *trigger words and associations*. And these are both key to effective mind mapping. If you learn mind mapping just by buying some computer software. There is a great tendency that you'll miss a great deal of the benefits because all you're actually doing is creating what I call circular lists. The second thing that underpins effective mind mapping is the need to think differently the thought processes going on in your head in order to create effective mind maps are different from the way we were taught to think at school. So again throughout this course we are looking at and showing you and demonstrating this different way of thinking.

So on this course to summarize the purpose is to *teach your effective mind mapping* and in order to do that we will also be showing you *demonstrating the power of triggers and associations* which are key to the effective use of mind mapping. *And we'll be showing you the thought processes that you need to start putting into action to create effective mind mapping*.

==== Structure of the Course

image::mind-maps/course-structure.png[]

I'm going to talk about the structure of the course. Now when we learn anything new it's so much easier if we can break the process or technique down into simple steps. And this is the same whether you're learning to juggle or ride a bicycle or in this case learning to become an effective mind mapper. The process of learning mind mapping on this course I've divided into *eight steps* and I'll quickly take you through these as an overview.

*Step one* is getting us into the right frame of mind for the course being mentally prepared for new learning and putting time aside in your diary in order to do the course justice.

*Step two* is observing a mind mapper at work observing the master at work has always been how an apprentice starts out in any of the crafting professions and mind mapping is a craft as much as it is a tool or a process. So observation is a tried and tested start up method. So in this step you will be standing over my shoulder watching me seeing me create my mind maps whilst at the same time through my running commentary, you'll be hearing the thought processes going on in my head as I create the map. Do please pay attention to this commentary and don't rush through these lectures as I am sharing with you the thought processes that are required in order to construct effective mind maps. And this is different from the linear piece by piece way we were taught to think at school.

In the *third step* you'll be reading through a series of mind maps. What we are doing here is simply learning to read before we learn to write. Indeed I don't ask you to start creating drawing or writing your own mind maps until we get on to Step 6. So for now you are able to relax if all of this is new to you.

*Step 4* is a further opportunity to get the feel of the technique and to practice eye-hand-brain coordination when it comes to creating mind maps. Now this is a copying step and as most of us are not good at copying you may find initially that what you are creating will look somewhat different from what you are copying. So do pay attention to this step and don't skimp it. Basically what you're doing here is grasping the technique through the use of your writing hand.

In *Step 5* we spend some time ensuring that we've integrated the main key principles that underpin the construction of effective mind maps. So again don't leave out step 5. And whenever we review information we are telling our brain. This is important and I need to remember it. And it is this process of regular review which helps us to transfer new learning into our long term memory.

Then when we get to *step 6* you'll actually be creating your first mind maps with a helping hand from me.

And finally in *Step 7* you're creating your very own mind maps from scratch. #*And please don't be tempted to start drawing your mind maps until you get to this stage*#. Otherwise in my experience you'll find you'll have picked up some bad habits which can then be really difficult to rectify.

*Step 8* is where you look to put mind mapping into everyday practical use in your work in your life and you'll be reflecting upon what you've learnt and planning out how best to make use of mind maps for you personally going forward. Practice makes permanent and good practice makes for effective mind mapping.

==== YES you can SUCCEED with this course - Allaying Any Fears

Now I know that when any of us start a new course we can sometimes feel a little anxious about whether we have the skills to succeed in the course. So I just want to say a few things to allay your fears. *Mind mapping when taught properly will work for every type of learner*. The key thing is being taught properly and this course is built around breaking the process of mind mapping down into simple steps which is the most effective way to learn something new is a little step at a time.

So we take the course in small steps and because it's a video course you can work at your own pace. So mind mapping will work for you whatever your learning aptitude. So if you feel that you're a very slow learner mind mapping will definitely work for you. Equally if you feel you are a fast learner a mind mapping is going to be truly effective for you. If you've been told that your primary learning style is visual the mind mapping will work for you. If you've been told your learning style is kinaesthetic mind mapping taught properly will work for you and if you've been told that your primary learning style is auditory then again taught properly and effectively mind mapping will really work well for you. If you're an artistic type of person if you like to doodle for example mind mapping will work for you. But if your not artistic at all and in fact you cannot draw mind mapping will work for you. So to summarize in order for you to learn to become an effective mind map it does not depend on one iota on any of the learning preferences that you may have. It really is down to the effectiveness of the teaching and I've been teaching mind mapping now for nearly 20 years and I have taught all age groups I have taught people with learning difficulties. Children with special needs talented learners. I have taught a whole spectrum of people mind mapping. I've talked shop floor workers, chief executives how to be an effective mind mapper so I know through experience that taught properly mind mapping will work for anyone and everyone. *One of the key things is not to rush into the mind mapping is to break it down into simple steps and that's what we do in this course*. So I hope I laid your fears. I want you to sit back relax and enjoy the cou

==== Getting into the Right Frame of Mind for Learning

Well done everyone. You've just completed the first section of the course and whilst doing so you've learned the first secret of effective learning for a new technique. And that is to get into the right frame of mind. You are now ready to go on to start Section 2.

=== Section 2: Observer a Mind Mapper at Work

==== Benefits of Mind Mapping

image::mind-maps/benefits.png[]

Okay, I want to mind map the benefits of mind mapping. So let's see how we might go about that. Okay so what are some of the benefits of mind mapping it's *great productivity tool*. It helps us to *reduce the times* of certain things so want to put that on. And it's a very versatile technique and it's *visual and spatial*. The benefits of spatialness is to make visible certain stuff so it's to see stuff But if it's a mind map one of the key things is that it reduces the time again if you're artistic you can always put in some thing representing the time...it reduces the time to learn. an L plate saying that the L represents learning so reduces the time for learning. Well anything really so learning a speech a poem learning for a test. So on preparing for an interview reduces the time to prepare things like a draft an article talk as a technique. It's very useful for sorting stuff out for organizing and sorting. For presenting for improving. For sparking creativity. So If we do stuff spatially it makes clearer use memory that this is visual spatial. Can you see how we can work I can add detail here. Here I can I don't have to work in a linear way so it can go and have a think about sorting the fact that the technique helps us sort out. Any ideas or issues that we may have. Simplifying clarifying spatializing it sorts naturally helps us us to be quite concise about stuff with presenting we can deliver presentations that are engaging articulate improve our decision making judgements note taking and with a mind map it helps us to see the whole. And also with the detail. So it is very much context helps us to see the context as well as the detail and helps us discover new connections new ones and actually rediscover old ones and it helps us to see our thinking our thoughts very important because How often do we reflect upon our thinking. Thinking can be divergent which sort of is often referred to as brainstorming. In thinking we can see is it joined up or not. And important for me is what I call convergent thinking which is moving from the complex to simple. Say something about the actual process of mind mapping itself the process itself helps clarify and it helps us to use utilize brain better clarifies ideas and thoughts we are displaying what we could describe as a mental model of the world our mental model and the process facilitates the process facilitates our understanding and facilitates what can be called sense making. It's a process that helps us communicate ideas to other people. communicate is probably a good overview of some of the benefits of mind mapping and then to just finally enhance the map we can add colour.

==== Mind Map a Holiday

*Mind Map an Article*

Okay this video is about looking at how we use my mapping to summarize an article or a book. Now I've taken an article that I wrote some years ago called cultivating the mind. The full title called cultivating the mind for positive health because I wrote it for the magazine. Positive health. And and I'm going to look at this as if I am mind mapping the article, now I would have created a mind map when I wrote the article. All those years ago. I haven't got the original. So what I've done is I've re-read the article and I've created a mind map Now at the moment I really want to show you just the main branches to the mind map and so I've coloured those in because one of the things that the colour does it it. It accentuates. And I'm going to read this as if This was just by an author that I'm not especially familiar with obviously as I said I wrote the article. Would I want to show you how it would look how you would read it if you were reading the mind map that was created as a summary of an article.

So what the author has done here *has chunked the topic into seven main areas*. And actually *chunking* is an important component of mind mapping and we'll be dealing with that in a later section of this course. So let's have a look. Just very briefly at the seven main chunks for the for the article and I've got the red laser pen here. There was uh exercise. So a section on exercising a section on. On learning. And how we learn a section on brain waves and their importance. A section on multiple intels and I've got here the I used an abbreviation. Intel is quite an interesting abbreviation for intelligence because we've all heard of the Intel inside. Microprocessors for computers. You know you have multiple Intels inside your brain. If you like inside your personal computer. And so that's quite a nice play on words. But multiple Intel's means multiple intelligences so there's a section on multiple intelligences a section on competence how we gain competence in a skill. A section on the architecture of the brain. And then at the very end of the article a little bit about mind mapping as this was actually part 1 of a two part article. Part 2 was on on mind mapping and so this article really sort of led into that so just a little bit of an introduction about mind mapping so so that gives a summary of the main headings if you like the main subheadings some of the article. What I'm going to do is I'm going to sort of read this for you. And I'm going to do this by actually colouring in. Now one of the great things about mind mapping is if you add the color later which is *what I actually recommend it's my preference to create a mind map in black and white and then colour in the branches. At the end is as we colour. We can review what we've what we've done*. Now given you a choice here you may have read this article already it's in the resources section of this course. So you may have already chosen to to read it in which case this is reviewing for you what you've read. Equally if you haven't read the article yet this is wetting your appetite to read up on if not the whole of the article on sections of the article which grab your interest as I point out the things that are dealt with in the various sections so. The first part is about we know about exercising the body we know about a healthy body and we sort of know about a healthy mind. But do we exercise the mind in the same way as we exercise the body so there's a section about that and how we might think about exercising the mind a sort of a brain gym as opposed to just having a body gym. Then there is learning. So then there is is learning. And in this section it's about learning how to learn the L plate there. I can put a key to that so that anybody can read this mind map. But a little L plate is the abbreviation I always use in my mind maps to signify learning. So learning how to learn and there's some very interesting stuff about learning cycle the learning cycle that I like to use is from a guy called Phil Race. And if we ever want to add any detail to a mind map that is not in the mind map form that should go in the very periphery of the of of the mind map. So I have just outlined there what the race cycle is and it doesn't matter if you cannot read it at the resolution of the camera because one of the things in the next little section where we focus on just one or two important aspects of cultivating the mind I will be talking briefly about the learning cycle in detail. There's a little bit about learning preferences what some people call learning styles. And the three main recognized learning styles have always been visual auditory and kinaesthetic, so there's something about that in the article. And also about learning rhythms and the rhythms are really to do is how we can maximize how we can use certain of the brain rhythms to maximize retention of information. And and recall. So for example as an optimal amount of time to review what you've learnt in order to transfer it from short term to long term memory, now brainwaves Now I had a senior moment when I was preparing this so I've already coloured in the the. The brainwaves there in brown. Use the marker now. So brainwave talk about the main brainwave states of which there are four. And these four are Beta Alpha Theta and Delta. As a quick summary B eta is the wave brain wave for alertness for escaping from the sabertooth tiger. Alpha wave is the wave for focussed attention. Theta wave is the wave for reverie and daydreaming which is particularly good for the digestion of learning and for long term memory and Delta wave which is sleep is also very important for long term memory. So a summary a very brief summary there of the four brain waves states. And one of the things that mind mapping is doing it is chunking in to what we will discover are levels of hierarchy so brain wave is the top level for this category. Beta, Alpha, Theta and Delta are the sub details and then more detail detail about Beta detail about our Alpha detail about Theta detail about Delta on the more on the periphery so the mind map is always moving from the key heading the key category through to low. What we can call lower levels of abstraction. So from the concept down to the detail in the periphery. There is also a section on multiple intelligences and it really just mentions what those main ones are and in how Gardner's original work. There were seven multiple intelligences and I can colour these in now. There's the yellow and the the seven intelligences are logical linguistic physical visual-spatial. musical. And two personal intelligences interpersonal. And intrapersonal intrapersonal is the intelligence about yourself within you. Within your own body and interpersonal intelligence is the intelligence the social intelligence of being able to communicate well with other persons. Then there's a section on competence and. We can be unconsciously. uncompetent which is the first stage and then. Consciously uncompetent and then consciously competent and then unconsciously competent, so these are numbered one two three four so that's the section on competence. Then there's a section on brain architecture. And this is subdivided into three sections. The individual cell which is the neuron there's a section about the triune brain. The fact that the architecture of the brain is such that it's almost like it's three brains in one. And McLean who came up with this model. Talked about reptilian mammalian. And human. So we got three brains. And there's also a section on the left and the right side of the brain so quickly summarizing the whole thing the brain cell is the neuron there's. It's not really known how many they are there are so many of them. Ten billion is one estimate. And each of those neurones scan have up to 20 thousand connections. If you look at the triune brain the reptilian brain is the brain of survival it's our survival brain our instincts brain and our habits brain. It's the brain where we store any new habits that we form the mammalian brain is our social and emotional brain and our human brain. We can think of as our thinking brain and this human brain is divided into the left and the right side. And this is the brain for the right side is synthesis and creativity and the left. is analysis and logic. So the thing about mind mapping is that it is a technique that is exceptionally brain friendly. *mind mapping Helps us to structure information hierarchically which is the way the brain naturally likes to structure information. It's a spatial technique so it taps into our visual spatial and our spatial working memories and it helps us to work nonlinearly which again is the way the brain. Was programmed*. To get it's best effort is to work in a nonlinear. Not in a linear fashion. Okay so there we are as I've coloured that in. I've sort of given an overview of the article so if you haven't read the article yet you may now like to to to read it and then use this as a review of what what you've read. The mind map can go out easily to one further level of abstraction. If you want to do that so by that I mean. That for example if you wanted. After you read up on brain waves if you wanted to add some stuff about Beta wave Alpha wave Theta wave or Delta wave there is room to add that without needing to. have a further map without needing to redraw the map and you can have any little doodles you can put out here on the periphery of the map. And if necessary put a little arrow to join them in so any real sort of detail should be right out here on the periphery. And a good map will also have white space in between the branches. As much as possible because again that helps the brain separate the various key ideas. So there you a mind map This is a way of summarizing an article or a book using the mind mapping technique. There you go.

==== The 4 Stages of Learning Anything New

Right. In this video I'm going to talk you through one of the or some of the key points from the mind cultivating the mind article. Where I want to emphasize certain things. First of all I'm going to talk to you about. The *race learning cycle* I found this cycle to be very simple far superior to more complex learning cycles like the *Kolb cycle*. So I'm going to talk you through the various steps of of this cycle and what Phil Race discovered in his research that there are *four basic processes* which can be put in a cycle which are *the processes for effective learning*. And the first one of these. The first. Process if you like. That has to be present for any effective learning is the *wanting stage*. And if you don't want to do something it makes it exceedingly difficult to to learn about it. You have all paid money to come on this mind mapping course so initially at the front end of the course you all have the desire to learn more about mind mapping and to integrate mind mapping into your own work and life. So that's good my role as a tutor is to make sure that the level of wanting to do this remains high. So I'm continually showing you new possibilities of ways you can use mind mapping that perhaps you hadn't thought about before the Course started. So you need to come to the course with a with a good desire and with an idea of what's in it for you. And I need through the course as tutor to keep that level of want as high as we can. If you do find for example during the course that you are wanting to do it is waning then that would make a good question to have to pose to me as tutor. Now providing the want is there then that really gives us the motivation to to do stuff. And primarily what the students were saying when they said that the doing stage became important to them for for learning. That is that the the doing stage basically is practice. Is practicing something. To see how it works. So there's plenty of practice in this course. Initially the practice will be kept to you reading some mind maps and then copying them but eventually the practice will move on to you creating your own mind maps. You can't learn any new technique just completely in your head. You need to physically start doing it. The next stage is is that is the feedback so the thing is that when we do something for the first time it's never going to be perfect. In fact really nothing we do should ever be perfect. Because we always want to be improving. Change is constantly happening in the world around us. So if we have the idea that we've created something that's perfect. We will not move with with the times. So. We're not trying to be perfect. We're trying to do our best efforts. And then we look at feedback. and how we could improve. So the thing is when you're doing and you're when you start to when we get to the stage where you're creating your own mind maps don't be too hard on yourself initially because like when you first got on a bike to ride it you will have a few scrapes a foot a few fall offs. But those of you that do ride bikes were continually motivated enough to get back on that bike and do better next time. Once they hear any feedback which is the next important stage in the in the learning process. And that feedback comes from two places. Feedback comes from outside of you it comes from your peers and friends. And on this course there's the opportunity for me to give you some feedback if you want it. As we go along. But don't forget the feedback that you give yourself. *And one of the reasons that we give up doing things is often that self talk that very negative self taught. Which says I don't like this I can't do it*. And so on always try and reframe stuff in a positive way. I sometimes give the example of Edison when he was. *Trying to create the The light bulb. Is that he had many potential failures. And when he was asked why he kept going he said he and only he knew. A thousand ways not to succeed with making a light bulb. So he felt he was ahead of the pack. So you know he had potentially thousands of so-called failures but he saw it in a positive light was that he was further down the learning path than anybody else because he'd had so many of these potentially negative experiences*. So you do need to reframe your feedback in the most positive way that you can. Otherwise you will suppress your wanting. And so one of the things about this as a cycle negative feedback will suppress the desire to do stuff. So do always look at giving yourself reframing. The feedback in in a positive slant that I've not done it very well this time next time is going to be even better. That is a positive way of reframing. *The fourth stage for the learning cycle*. Is the digestion stage. And really this for me is the stage that our education system seems to be totally oblivious to this being important so the race cycle isn't rocket science. I guess you know when you heard me talk about you need to be motivated that's the wanting stage that you need to practice. That's the doing stage and that you need feedback in order to improve and to correct so-called errors. You know you will have intuitively known those steps but *digestion for me is the step that most people and even our education system seem to be totally unaware of. Digestion is the stage Phil Race said that digestion is the stage where you take ownership of the learning*. And it's a it's a lovely word. We know intuitively what digestion is because we you know we every day we eat stuff and we digest it and we have a sort of recognition that what digestion means is breaking. In this case food breaking food down into its smallest component parts so that we can absorb it into our system. And then the final part of the digestive process is that some of this is used some of the food the calories is used for for our energy for our movement and for our doing things. Some of it actually then becomes incorporated into our body. So when we are growing for example a lot of the calories a lot of the food a lot of the digestive products are needed for growth. And so we can see that information and knowledge. Is food for the brain and that this knowledge that we absorb from the outside needs to be broken down into its smallest components in order for us to assimilate it into our brain. And that assimilation process is. Sort of done by connecting the new bits of information with what is already in our head. The brain is an associative machine and we learn well it's not a machine sorry it's an associative instrument. No even instrument is not a very good word. *It has an associative function it learns by associating new stuff with with the with or with old stuff* *the digestion phase for knowledge is to break it down into its component parts. And then to play with it. In such a way that we can begin to attach it to stuff that we already know. And that's how we assimilate it we assimilate the new bits of information by connecting it to stuff that is already in our heads*. Digestion for me is a great term. It's more than reflection although it includes reflection now digestion Really needs the Theta wave. Which is the wave of reverie and daydreaming. So to digest the learning on this course in between the various lectures you really do need to allow your self time to sit quietly and just think and daydream around what you've learned so far. That is how you do the digestion stage of learning. In the UK we have politicians and I think it's the same in America who who believe that. In the education system in schooling that took children should not be wasting their time and that every moment of the day should be filled with activities. There was a time in primary schools in the UK where the very young children could have a little sleep a little nap in the afternoon. A bit a quiet time a brilliant way to digest the learning. In some of the Far East countries they they allow the students time to do a sort of a visualization a meditation if you like. Again another brilliant way To help digest the learning. In in the UK in our schools we simply don't understand this. There's no digestion time as far as I can see within the school and life is so hectic. Once you get the kids get home there's not much time for digestion either. So I want you to succeed in this course I believe at the start of the course you are wanting to succeed is going to be high and my job is to keep that at a high level. There will be lots of exercises during the course. So there's plenty of doing. You will need to give yourself feedback a lot of the time because you know I'm not there with you. But by posing questions through the through the course I can give you a feedback. And one thing I can't do for you is the digestion of the learning. This is quiet time that you need for yourself to reflect upon what you've learnt. And in these reflection times that you're hopefully going to give yourself. It's also a time to see how you can transfer this technique to your daily life and work perhaps even in ways that I don't have and haven't thought about on the course itself. So there you go. This is the the race cycle It's very simple. If you leave out one of these stages or one of the stages is very weak you will find learning to be hard and difficult. If at any stage you find you're struggling with any aspect of the course Come back to this cycle and ask yourself which of these stages is causing me the difficulty. So if the wanting stage begins to wain You need to see if you can address that. If the doing if you're not doing enough practice that's the doing stage then you're not going to succeed and integrate this into a way of working in your daily practice. If you skimp the feedback and if you don't talk positively to yourself about this course. Then again that will impede your desire to continue. And if you don't give yourself quiet time to sit and digest and doodle and daydream about the course again you will make learning difficult. So I just like to say a little bit more about the digestion phase of learning from the perspective of. *Is there a way we can make digestion of information easier*. And the answer to that is yes we can *if we arrange information hierarchically*. And if we focus on the at the top of the hierarchy first which is the the main heading if you like and we don't what concern or bother ourselves with the detail until we understand the the the top level category. Let me give you an example because it makes it so much more obvious by an example. When you were a baby. And you just started to talk. And you saw a four legged creature with a tail. One of your parents would have labelled it for you. And in this case let's say dog. So four legged creature with a tail is dog Now then for days or weeks or sometimes months every four legged creature with a tile will be a dog. What the parent doesn't do is they don't. And we know this intuitively. They don't try and say that that's a boxer or that's a dachshund. They don't do that. They don't go into detail. Too early dog is a sufficient category to label to help them label that four legged creature with a tail. And what parents will do over the coming months is when they see a four legged creature that isn't with a tail that isn't a dog. Then they will get them to differentiate that. So the thing is we don't go into too much detail too early when we're teaching our children new information. We do however when we get into the education system it all seems to me based around going too early into detail before we've got the the main categories before we've got the big picture. So the parents role will be to help the child differentiate dog from cat from rabbit from horse from cow all the other four legged creatures that have a tail. And it's not until they're got a fairly clear picture of the main every day different types of creatures that they're likely to encounter that we then start to tell them that this is a specific type of cat. This is a Siamese cat or a specific specific type of dog. This is a boxer dog. So we should only bring more detail into the picture once we have got the main level categories. And one of the things that mind mapping does so this brings us back to mind mapping and why it's so good it is predigesting the information for you. Once you put information onto a mind map or your reading information that's been placed on to a mind map it has been digested hierarchically with the top level categories as the main branches. And that the detail will be towards the periphery of the map. So mind mapping. The process of mind mapping. Whether you're reading somebody else's mind map or whether you're creating your own that process is a great process for the digestion of information.

I want to teach out some key points. Okay so here diagrammatically we see the left and the right side of the brain. And if it if you want to remember the difference between the two types. L is our logical side And right is our rhythmical side. Okay. Logic is a step by step sort of process and is works with detail and and rhythm if you think about rhythm. It's the underlying structure to to music and to poetry and so rhythm is about the underlying structure so the right side of the brain is interested in working with patterns and underlying structure. So two easy ways to remember the difference about which side is which the left is the logical the right the right is the rhythmical and the side that likes patterns at a physiological level. The research has been done to show that the actual structure of the brain cells of the neurones is different in the left side to the right side. And the left side the neurones make fewer connections but do seem to drill down deeper if if you like. And the right side the neurones are much more interconnected. And so at a neuronal brain cell level or we can see that the brain cells on each side become specialized for certain tasks so the tasks that the brain cells on the left side are extremely effective at is is breaking things down into its bits. So it is very much a bit by bit processor. It's our digital processor if you like our rhythmic brain is our analogue processor interested in patterns and and analogues now digital is bit by bit so *the left side of the brain does most of the processing when we have bit by bit things to do. And the right side of the brain likes to work with the whole thing. It likes the big picture*. It is the side that is the side of dreaming and the right side of the brain is much more connected with what we can call our subconscious mind. So it's the side of dreaming for example. As we get older we don't remember much of our dreams but when we were younger. our dreams were very very vivid and they're very they feel very real and they're like watching a video. So this comes from the right side of the brain it is the video side as opposed to the digital bit by bit which is like individual photos. The right side the brain works with. With video. Now when the right side of the brain hasn't got the whole picture as it often hasn't it likes to fill in spaces to make the whole picture. So you know those magic pictures where if you stare at them long enough a three dimensional figure jumps out on the page and at you a left sided brain cannot make sense of those. But because of because most of us through our education are left brain dominant it often takes a bit of time that the three dimensional figure to pop out. And that's because it's a right brain skill to do that. So sometimes it takes quite a bit of time and some people say they just can't you know. The pictures do not appear. And this is because the left side of the brain continues to try and solve the puzzle which it which it can't do. There are various exercises is not part of the course here. There are various exercises that we can do to encourage the right side of the brain to to take the lead. But just in this video I just want to make the point that each side of the brain has a preference and a skillset and a neuronal structure that processes information in different ways. So the left side was the bit by bit processor and the right side if it hasn't got the whole thing. It likes to fill in spaces and make some holes. Now you call that process synthesis and we can call the breaking down into bits analysis the left side of the brain is our analytical side loves to break things down into its bits. It loves to work then with the bit and the right side of the brain is our synthesis side. It loves to create holes and this is the main reason why the right side the brain is often seen as the creative side because creativity is much more to do with synthesis than it is to do with analysis. But there's a lot of you know recent research has shown we really need both sides of the brain working in harmony with each other to be at our most creative. So I'm not talking about here about the left or the right side either side being the best. They each have their skillset. They each have processors that work in different ways. And so when we're working on an issue ideally need to engage both sides of the brain. Now in a minute this is going to bring us back to to Mind mapping and why Mind mapping is such a good technique.

*The left side of the brain loves mind maps once it understands them the issue is getting to understand that working in a different way is to its advantage. But once it understands that and that's one of the reasons why in this course we do. We do it in simple stages. We do a stage of observation of a mind mapping master at work and then we'll be doing reading exercises so we are keeping it really simple so that the left side of the brain can begin to grasp the effectiveness of of this technique which because it's been taught to work in a specific why it often impedes the learning of new techniques to start with. So once the left side of the brain gets it once it grasps the helpfulness of the technique then the left side of the brain will love mind mapping because when it when it sees the mind map it sees all the bits. The mind map is just a network of trigger words and trigger words are bits or particles of information. So it has before it a network of pieces arranged conveniently in a hierarchical form which both sides of the brain likes because actually your brain learns in a hierarchical fashion*. We learn much faster when the information can be pre organized into its hierarchies so the left side of the brain. actually loves my mapping once it grasps the idea the right side the brain also loves mind mapping because it likes to do the synthesis it likes to fill in the spaces so in order to read a mind you'll find this out in the next section in order to read a mind map. *The right side of brain can get to work helping to synthesize the trigger words the key words on the map and to fill in the gaps and fill in the spaces* mind mapping is a technique is that when you're either reading a mind map or creating your own maps without you thinking about it you are actually engaging both sides of the brain. *Because you're doing the bit by bit work but you're also doing the the synthesis work*. It's mind mapping is the only technique that for me really means that effortlessly you're engaging both sides of the brain now as well as the *right side of the brain. Liking the filling in of the spaces. It also likes to see the big picture which is the overall map and it also likes to see the pattern*. *Because as I've mentioned already the right side of your brain is the is the side that appreciates and can absorb the underlying patterns. So a mind map is working with both sides of the brain* and one of the problems with our traditional way of learning and our education system is that most of what we're asked to do at school is bit by bit processing. So the three R's reading writing and arithmetic are all taught generally in a bit by bit fashion. And so we're continually exercising the left side of the brain at school but we don't bring the right side of the brain very much into sort of the daily practice within the learning environment. And if we did more mind mapping and if teachers appreciated the benefit of proper mind mapping not the spider diagrammy things that they sometimes demonstrate to their pupils if they understood the real genuine benefits of mind mapping of engaging both sides of the brain we would see more mind mapping being done at school or in the classroom. The other thing I'd like to emphasize is that there is quite a bit of evidence now *that the mammalian brain was designed to be right brain dominant not left brain dominant* and as I've just said cause of the the way the we emphasize on the logical linear bit by bit stuff in school. Most people leaving the education system come out left brain dominant. And it's interesting actually that that the very creative people like Einstein and know some of the entrepreneurs failed at school. Einstein in particular believed that the reason of his creativity and his creative ideas was that he just didn't get it at school. He he's he's brain wasn't influence he didn't leave school as a left brain dominant. And for someone who finished up being a great mathematician which we associate often with the left side of the brain. Einstein is an example of someone who appreciated the importance of of the of the right side of his brain in in in how he became what what he was a lot of the evidence for. The fact that the mammalian brain was designed to be right brain dominant can be found in a book by a professor Ian McGilchrist. And you know I'm not going to go into that in any more other than to say that *if we approach issues that we are seeking to find solutions to with the right side of the brain as the master and the left side of the brain as the supporting emissary we will actually get to solutions much much quicker* then if we take a left brain dominant approach and one of the things that Ian McGilchrist argues is that we've had a few hundred years of a culture of left brain dominance processing which has led to fragmentation of things like services fragmentation of the way we were silo thinking a silo thinking will always lead to unintended consequences. And you know in in politics in particular the way politicians dabble in stuff they're always finishing up with these oh we didn't realise you know that we would have these unintended consequences well if they went into the problem allowing the right side of the brain their brain to be dominant in the first instance to get the whole picture then we wouldn't have that what we have today from reductionist thinking because reductionist thinking is thinking coming from the left side of the brain just to finish you know a lot of our sciences reductionist thinking and the roots of it go back to Newton reductionist thinking in science can be sort of extrapolated back to to Isaac Newton. And the interesting thing about Newton was he came up with this mechanistic view of the universe purely to help us solve some of the big problems mainly to do things like you know planets moving and then motion and gravity. The thing was that Newton had other models for science. He didn't believe that the reductionist way of thinking the mechanistic way of thinking was the only way to think about are the issues of the day as far as models of alchemy for example. So you can see with Newton that he he actually believed that we needed to use different ways of thinking to solve different problem. And you know this is one of the. difficulties that we have today is that for so long in our society we've been using the left side of the brain with its reductionist thinking never intended to be like that by Newton. But cherry picked as an idea by scientists that followed him. *And so one of the things that we need in our day to day work is to get back to using the right side of the brain more in everyday tasks*. And because as I've said when your mind mapping and when you start to use the thinking processes that I'll be describing in this this course when your mind mapping you are letting the right brain take the initial lead on every task.

==== Mindmapping 'How to Mind Map'

OK, I'm constructing now a mind map that's going to summarize the principles of how to mind map, and what I've done so far is that I put the topic in the center, how to mind map and I've divided. I know I'm going to be dividing my topic up into what we do at the start. What are the principles? How we and why we enhance mine maps and the importance of the structure.

So we can say that the start of the mind map by using paper. The paper is blank. And very important. The paper is always in the landscape. Orientation. We start the map in the center. Center of the map. Key thing is that the topic? Is in the center. And the topic is made. Like an icon. Or some no. To represent the topic and the important thing is that the topic should stand out. And we do that by using size. Dimension. You can also use color. And I will be using color on this, but I'll probably out the coloreds at the very end. And the topic has, if you like, outgrowths. Which are its branches?

So let's say something about the *principles*, and I'm going to divide this into three things ironer. Summarized the importance of the branches. I'm going to summarize the importance of words and how we use them. I'll summarize the importance of structure. You know, we use the branches as an aide. To emphasise. And we do this by varying. Branches so thick. Thin, thick in the center. Seen in the periphery. And the other important thing about branches is that they're lenght. Equals. The importance of how words fits. Onto online map is that they sit on the branches. Not under any subbranches or not at the end of the branches, but they sit on the branches. *Words are one word. Branch. And we only use key words*. Now, I just want to emphasize on this that the structure of the mine map is really the most important thing. So we'll be saying more about that later. But just to emphasize that. One of the things that the structure of the mind does is it retains. Association's. And the connections. And we can also describe the structure as being organic. And sort of flowing. OK, no straight lines in an effective mind map. The lines are always an organic. US lines are always in nature. So it's something about the enhancing law. First of all, why bother? To enhance a mind map. Well, the thing is. *If we enhance a map, we will find that it's an aid to. Absorption. The information. It helps the retention. And it helps recal*. Now, really and truly, the only way that you as the student will prove this to yourselves is by using mind maps, enhancing them and seeing how good they are at helping you to remember and recall vast amounts of information. And we enhance mine maps. With or by or through. Enhance mind maps through doing a number of things with the three main ones are *adding color*. Using other forms of emphasis. Such as mentioned already, *size*. And the other key thing is through. *Personalizing your mind*. Now, one of the most important things that helps us to absorb the information retain is and recall it is the personalization. So new information needs somewhere to connect. And so the more we connect it to ourselves and our personality and we put our own. So let's put this on here. We put our own style. Onto the map, we'd like it like we put our own stamp on it. So instead of becoming someone else's notes. This is definitely our summary, our notes. So color emphasis, such as size and personalizing are the ways that we best enhance maps and then want to say something about the structure. So the thing is design. Architecture, the design of the mine achieves certain. Important things, one is that the *design is spatial*. Another is that the *design is hierarchical*. It's categorical. And by that, I mean it divides the topic up into categories or groups. So with spatial, we get 360 degrees we can use. Allows us to separate ideas, separation. The idea is. Spacing out spatial and we tap into. How spatial memory. Spatial working memory, hierarchical. That's actually there's multiple hierarchies. Which we can call radiant. It's a radiant hierarchy, more structure and categorical as we place things in two into categories. *The structure also promotes. chunking* footnoting Cameron Toombs. Chunks of bite size, small chunks on a Walmart and *Chunking does aid does aid. Digestion*. ofThe information. So in the same way as to digest food, we need to break it down into its smallest parts, chunking into small parts is helps the digestion for the brain of the information that it wishes to to absorb. *So this structure has a specific design. It promotes the chunking of information*. And actually we're chunking down as we go from the center of the map outwards. *And the final thing is that the structure is a network of keywords and associations*. And one of the important things about key words. His single words are great triggers right, so. I could put a little. Icon of the brain in there, if I wanted to, to signify that it's makes the information very brain friendly. Now, normally when I'm colouring in, I'm talking to myself and reviewing what I've put on there. But because of the way I want the video to run, what I'm going to do is I'm going to color it all in. And then I'm going to review what I've done. But so we can speed up the coloring in a moment.

OK, so how to Mind Map? We started the mind map. With blank paper in the landscape mode. We started in the center here putting a topic. So we've we've made, though, the subject how to mind map into a bit of an icon of our son now. And I usually do this by making at least one of the words sort of two dimensional, which I can then color in. So we made the topic an icon. We're using size and dimension and color to make it stand out. And then we've got outgrowths and we've actually got four outgrowths as branches from the main topic. The main principles of the mind map is that our branches are there as an aide to emphasis. And this is why we vary the thickness thick at the center, thin at the periphery. So really like tree branches, thick branches here. And then as we move to the periphery, more like two weeks. The other thing is that the length of the branch should roughly equal the length of the word. So you don't have a big branch and a tiny word. I mean, I I've I've almost made start. They're too small for it to stand out on the on the line, you know, ideally should have made it a little bit bigger. You should be able to stand back from a mine map course on a computer, see a low resolution image of the mind map, and you should be able to read the center and the main branches. If you can't, then that is a poorly constructed mind map, because what you're putting on the paper space is what is being imprinted in the mind in your head. So if you haven't imprinted what the topic is and what the main categories of that topic are, you have an imprinted that well on the paper. You won't imprint that well in your head. The structure I think I've done the words, the words sits on branches, one word on a branch and the words are keywords only. *So there's no ifs or buts and ands, really hardly any adjectives and adverbs. Its mostly nouns with some active verbs* is is usually what makes good trigger words and important. The structure of the mind map is exceedingly important and this is the most difficult thing to grasp. It's that it's the tricky bit of mind mapping. And that's why on this course we will actually look at how you build the structure. That will be the last thing we do, and you'll need to know that when you start to create your own maps. The other important thing about the structure is that it retains all the important associations which less and bullet points lose. So this is why it is so much better for the brain to learn information, because the associations are kept in and it has an organic flowing feel. It's on the map. So the brain likes this. Some people have said that it mimics what a brain cell looks like. So the neuronal brain cells love this structure. Enhanced mind maps. Now, first of all, why? Well, when we enhance, we're aiding the absorption of the information. It's retention and it's Re-form. And as I've said, really, you can only demonstrate that for yourself through through practice and actually using it. How we enhance mine maps is through three specific things. Use of color. Other uses of emphasis, because obviously color is an emphasis such as size. So, you know, one way to emphasize that the center is to make it bigger. Very important is that you personalize your own maps. They'll have your own style. So you can follow all of these principles. But everybody's map will look different because it's personalized. So find some important points about the structure. Is that the design is spatial. This has a number of vantages where you can use 360 degrees. We can separate the idea. So can you see how there's plenty of white space between start and principles and white space between enhancing and and structure? So this helps the brain see the spatially the the important things. And we all have a spatial working memory, which we hardly use mind mapping, of course, is allowing us to to tap into this. And and basically we can only hold three complex ideas in our verbal working memory at any one time. But the mind map is in allowing us to hold a much more because we're tapping into our spatial. So. So we've sort of got three main points here. Three main points. The three, two or three main points. There are three main points here. And we we can hold those mentally, spatially in our heads at any one time. The design is hierarchical, multiple hierarchies, and there are gradients and and we all learn hierarchically whether you realize that or not. And during this course, one of the things that I will be saying more about is the importance of hierarchy, of arranging information hierarchically in order to make it easier to to learn and absorb. And we can say it's categorical because it divides every topic up into simple categories. So here the category is, I've done four categories. How you start a mind map. What are the principles? How you enhance? And what is the important things about the structure? The other thing that the structure promotes is *chunking* small chunks. And these are another right to digestion and l.p you if you've done an LP in the past, neurolinguistic programming, one of the things that they talk about is chunking up and chunking down. And so as we move from the periphery to the center, we are basically chunking up. So the biggest chunk, the highest level of abstraction, the biggest chunk is the topic go down one chunk, one hierarchical level. We've got how we start principles, how we enhance now a structure, and then we're moving out on the hierarchies to the detail. So we're chunking further down to the periphery of the mind map. And finally, the structure is, you can see really is a network of associations. So we keep the associations in, which is a very important part of the structure of the mind map. And the words single words on branch is now a lot of people don't get this. A lot of managers and consultants and things say, well, you know, we don't need to use individual key words when we're where mind mapping in business. We can use whole sentences and phrases if we want to weld. The proper thing is that you're missing a lot of the benefits of mind mapping to get information into your head and then get it back out again. *And there's a whole section in this course on showing you the power of single words, keywords as triggers*. So that's to come later in the course. So there we are. A mind map about how to mind map.

=== Section 3: Practise Reading Mind Maps

==== The Benefits from Reading

Well welcome to section three of the mind mapping course. This is the section where your task is to practice reading mind maps. And to make a note of how easy or difficult you find this process of reading from a well constructed mind map. There are three reading tasks for you to undertake. The first one is reading about a holiday in Goa. The second reading exercise is a mind map about how to mind map and then the final reading exercise is a mind map that is a book summary. The book is the Seven Laws of Success by Deepak Chopra. It's a book that I've mind mapped several years ago but I've created a fresh mind map for this course. The mind map book summary can be used in two different ways. If you've actually read the book then what you'll find is that the mind map becomes a way to quickly review what you have read. If you've not read the book then the mind map can wet your appetite to read the book or indeed can give you enough information to tell you that this isn't a book that you want to read. The reason that I get you to read some mind maps before we even consider creating them is because as you will discover reading a mind map is the easiest part of the process. *Now when you do the reading I'm going to encourage you to read out loud*. And indeed a very effective thing to do is to record yourself as you read the the maps. It's very easy today if you've got a computer with the appropriate software and a built-in microphone to record yours your speech *when you read out loud as opposed to sort of vocalizing the words in in your head is your actually lighting up more of your brain or using more of your brain cells to read out loud than to to read silently and the benefits of recording yourself is that you play it back and reflect upon how coherent and how flowing your speech is*. And one of the things that you'll discover is that the more that you read out mind maps the better the natural flow of your reading. So if you go back and re-read the maps you'll notice that the second and third time that you re-read them that your speech will be more coherent and more flowing. You'll find that with the experience that the reading gets easier and easier as your brain if you like gets used to filling in the spaces between the keywords.

But basically you're decoding a particular type of code which is the mind map. And to do that you're having to fill in the spaces what I call the spaces between the key words we said earlier the right side of the brain likes to do this but the right side of the brain hasn't always got much of a look in in your education at school. So sometimes it can just take a little bit of extra time to get to get comfortable with it. So I would suggest that you record if you can record your readings listen to them see how comfortable you were reading and do it at a second time perhaps a day later and see how much more comfortable you are in decoding the maps. What I'd like you to reflect upon as well after each of the reading exercises is how easy or difficult did you find the actual exercise of decoding in this case someone else's mind map. Now bear in mind that when we get to the last section and you starting to create your own mind maps mostly the maps that you create will simply be for yourself. So because you created them you should be able to decode then with ease. Reading other people's maps is more tricky than reading back your own map and The only reason that it's generally the feedback that I get is people read the mind maps I have created very easily. The reason for that is all the experience that I have in creating these. These brain friendly map. So what I'm hoping this section will demonstrate for you is that mind maps are easy to decode other people's mind maps are easy to decode providing they have been created with care and attention. And when it comes to creating your own mind maps and reading back those to yourself. Well because you created them the likelihood of you being able to decode them is is exceedingly high. So without further ado let's get going after each of the individual exercises. There's just a little quiz to see how much information you have gleaned from the map that you have read.
