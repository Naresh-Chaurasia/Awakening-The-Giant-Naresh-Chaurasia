=== Section 1: Introduction

*Introduction*

Welcome to master your emotions, including uncertainty, stress, anxiety and fear.  Most of us have been told lies about emotions for all of our lives.  We're told that they're bad, that we shouldn't express certain ones.  We're told that we should trust our gut.  But at the same time, we're told that emotions are irrational and shouldn't be trusted.  We're told that emotions happen to us and therefore we have no control over it.  *But the truth is that that you can control your emotions.  You can get really good at experiencing the ones that you want and avoid the ones that you don't want*.  Think about an astronaut for a moment.  They train themselves to be completely in control of their emotional state.  And of course, they do that because it's a life or death situation and they have to have that control.  But they're human beings just like us, so they can control their emotions.  So can we.  The truth is that emotional self-control is possibly the most valuable skill that you could ever acquire.  *It helps you cope with whatever life throws at you.  It helps you prevent stress, anxiety and fear.  And it helps you unlock your abilities, frees you to live the life that you really want, and actually  has been linked strongly to what differentiates between people who are successful versus people who  are not*.  For most of us, no one ever taught us what emotions are or how they work.  No one taught us that we can control them because we can control our mind and therefore we can control  our lives.  *No one ever told us that it was the lack of emotional management that ends up leading to drama, to  suffering, to addiction, and to poor decisions, and that all of those things can be avoided*.

Emotions matter, and that's why we've created this course.  We'll focus on three of the most undesirable emotions uncertainty, insecurity, anxiety and worry and  fear, and how you can use emotional awareness and self-control techniques to take back control of your  emotions and feel better now.  What did you what your emotions really mean?  How to recognise them and how to direct them in a way that really allows you to move towards your life  goals and really your desires and what you want to create.  *We'll teach you how to get out of your head and become the observer of your emotions as they happen  so you can avoid being hijacked by your own brain and really feel control again*.  So after learning these tools, you'll be able to really feel good, or at least better.  *No matter what's going on around you or what life throws at you.  You stop your emotions from spiraling out of control.  You'll feel resilient and capable of handling life stressors.  You stop raising thoughts and calm your anxiety, your de-escalate, overcome, or prevent your fears.  You develop mindfulness by focusing on the present moment, and you also feel confident and in control  of your emotional state and your life*.

In this course, you will learn what emotions are and how they work, how to recognise them and identify  them.  How to direct your thoughts so that you can direct your emotions.  How to reframe situations that make you feel bad.  Find the blessing and then feel better.  You're going to learn stress reduction techniques, proven processes for preventing yourself from losing  control.  Emotionally, you learn tools to de-escalate.  When you're feeling anxiety or fear, you'll learn NLP or neuro linguistic programming techniques for  rewiring your emotions and anchoring positive ones.  You'll learn how to cope using humor and other self-empowerment techniques.  You'll develop self-confidence, uncertainty, and you'll master the feelings of hopefulness and feeling  joyful.

*Mind Body Emotional Connection*

I'm going to walk you through two quick activities that help you be able to experience the mind, body,  emotions, connection, and so if you understand that your emotions are almost always influenced by  your thoughts, then you can identify the emotion, identify the thoughts, change the thoughts, and  it gives you power over your emotions.  So I'm going to give you a quick demonstration.  So imagine your phone is ringing and you know who is calling.  And it's somebody that you have a feeling it's going to be telling you something really good and exciting.  So you answered the phone eagerly.  And sure enough, on the other end, they're telling you the best news you have ever, ever heard and  you can feel yourself getting really excited.  And the more you talk to them about it, the more wound up you get and you can feel yourself smiling.  It's like you can't hold it back and you can feel the excitement in your body and you feel yourself  to starting to move around.  And you're so overwhelmed with joy that you just want to put your hands up in the air and shake them  around and and you almost want to scream.  You're so excited.  So I want to ask you a question.  When you were imagining this, could you feel anything?  Could you feel any of those things I was talking about?  Did you have any sensations in your body that you feel yourself wanting to smile?  Did you feel any emotions now?  We only did that for a few seconds.  And if you were feeling a response to it, it's not like you actually received good news or a phone  call.  Right.  We were just pretending.  But yet your body and your mind react anyway.  And so that's a really great illustration that all it takes is our imagination to make us feel something.  And so what I'm here to tell you is that that is always happening to you.  What you are thinking in your mind is causing your emotions.  So it may be that the way you perceive things is you're seeing things around you and you're thinking  about the things that you're seeing and that's causing an emotion.  And so you blame the things that you're seeing.  But truly, the source of your emotion doesn't come from those things around you.  It comes from what's going on up here.  And so here's another example and this one, take that a step further.  And it shows you that it's not just that your emotions respond to your thoughts, but your whole body  does, too.  And so all three of these things are connected in this short visualization helps give you that idea.  So just imagine that I'm in their room with you and I come in with a plate full of these big, fat,  juicy limes.  And so I start cutting into the limes and even before I'm next, you can smell them.  That's how pungent they are.  And as I continue to cut them into quarters, the juice that just drips all over the place and I'm making  a huge mess.  And so I bring one over to you.  And I want you to imagine grabbing this big, juicy lime for me that I'm handing you right now.  And I want you to take the lime and I want you to put it in your mouth and take a big bite.  And feel the juices squirting into your mouth.  Now, ask yourself, do you feel anything funny in your mouth?  Is your tongue tingling?  Are you producing saliva?  Now it is happening and the reason why it's happening is because your mind doesn't know the difference,  it doesn't know that you're not eating alive because you're thinking about eating alive.  It's actually preparing your body, your mouth, your tongue, your digestive juices to break down the  acid in that lime.  And so just by thinking about eating alive, your body is responding.  So I hope that that gives you an illustration of how powerful your mind truly is in creating reactions,  both in your emotions and in your body.

=== Section 2: Understanding Emotions

*Biological and Psychological Foundations*

Our brain is a powerful tool that is designed to be efficient and to protect us. However, there are parts of it that may be a little outdated in today's society as we do not experience the same threats as we once did. So in this section, we will give you a basic psychological foundation as some of our emotions and the way that the body responds. So let's get started. The first one is a sabertooth effect. So we have a fight or flight response that is designed to save our cave dwelling ancestors from premature death in the jaws of a saber toothed predator. However, and today we don't have the same threats and we're in the top of the food chain, but we still recognize some of these symptoms of fight or flight in other ways that they're triggered. For example, somebody cuts us off in front of traffic or something happens at work or we're just stressed out with something that's happening in our with our kids in school that you might actually recognize this, because what tends to happen is that you have an increased heart rate. Your blood pressure goes up, your increased oxygen to the brain and you increase your muscle tension. You might even feel a boost of energy supplies without having to drink any coffee at the same time. There's also other things that are happening that the Mayo Clinic has pointed out that are out of the surface and you might not even notice that they're happening. For example, your altered immune system response, your digestive system is suppressed because really you don't need to be digesting food when you're trying to run away from something that's trying to eat you and make you its food. You also have a suppressed reproductive system and growth because if something's trying to kill you, you know, you're trying to focus on that priority instead of trying to save the species as a whole. And according to the National Institute of Mental Health, there are other systems that you might also be familiar with. This include lack of appetite, heartburn, nausea and stomach pain. And that's why you see some individuals and we'll talk more about digestion as we go along. But you'll see some individuals when they feel a little anxious or they're in that fight or flight response, they might have a stomach ache or they might feel nauseous and things like that. There are chemicals that are also being released in these situations and hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol. And these are released to save our lives. And they're supposed to return back to normal after the situation that threaten our lives. And in our modern world, our bodies do not normalize because our stress is not caused by threat of death. For us, everything looks like a two predator. Our stress is constant. We're in a perpetual state of fight or flight. Therefore, this prolonged stress can lead us to breaking down physically and mentally. You have to keep in mind that when you're in that state, it's almost like if your body's exercising but exercising all the time. So imagine if you were exercising all the time. What would that do to your mind and your body if you actually never give it time to rest? So let's look at some of the key parts of our brain. See, our brain has a part that's called the limbic system. This system houses some of the critical parts in our own emotions. For example, the amygdala, which is responsible for feeling of anxiety and fear. Many times when this part of the brain is activated because of an experience we may have, it turns out another part of the brain, which is the prefrontal cortex, this area helps us recent and critically think this is why when we get angry or anxious, we may react in ways that when we reflect back later on, we may question what were we even thinking at that time? Why would I say that or why would I do that? There has been numerous studies that have shed light. And what is the difference between someone that's emotionally resilient and those that are not? One of the strongest indicators is our connection between the left prefrontal cortex, which will call PFC and the amygdala. So the PFC is critical because it tells the amygdala that needs to quiet down by sending inhibitory signals so it helps our negative emotions subside and go away. It tells it you need to really stop because you need to stop feeling this way or is not rational or is not practical. So really quiet this down. Studies have shown that people who have a weaker connection between these two areas of the brain have more difficulties managing and regulating their emotions. *So now you may be thinking, what is that area of my brain is not well developed. Am I out of luck? The good news is that you're not and that you can help build those connection. It is important to keep in mind that the brain is like a muscle and that by working those areas, you can strengthen your connections*.

One of the ways that you can work out that sections through mindfulness meditation, you do this by becoming an observer of your thoughts without judging them. You're looking at it and saying, OK, that's what you're thinking. That's what. Processing and and so on and so on, but by doing this, you're observing how the brain can easily exaggerate a situation and go at unnecessary tangents. And by doing this, you're activating your PFC, which is a critical part of your brain to manage your emotions. So in other words, you're training it. You're building that muscle up in your brain to let it know it's time to turn on reasoning and critical thinking. Activate. It's almost like turning on a light switch. Therefore, you are practically working out your brain so we can learn how to turn on those areas during challenging times and that naturally assesses a thought without letting it consume you. Studies have also found that people that have a positive set point have an active PFC as well as nucleus accumbens. The nucleus accumbens is part of the brain that's associated with pleasure and a sense of reward and motivation. People that tend to be negative have Furo neural connections between these two areas of the brain. It is believed that this area can be reached to conscious thought. If this is true, you may ask then, does that mean that I will not be able to change my emotional set point? However, that is not necessarily the case. The ways that you can indirectly work out those connections in your brain. For example, in your in our current society, we are consistently stimulated by immediate rewards and we constantly seek it. For example, do you constantly check your phone, play mobile games or go to your social media to find out what's going on? That can actually be bad for this part of your brain? Because this habit can be addicting. Do not help build that part of your brain because you're not learning that self-control. That's actually that muscle that's helping me build it. So what does help is the first thing is planning and using your imagination to see what you want to create in the future and practicing self-control. Therefore, you can plan some of the activities. You can even plan some of your rewards that you're going to get once you achieve certain goals and things like that. I'll give you an example. If you have a habit of constantly checking your phone, you can force yourself not to check it until you reach a goal or finish some work that you're supposed to be doing instead. And by doing this again, you're building that muscle. So by practicing self-restraint, you're actually building that emotional part of yourself that will help you not only short term, but actually long term. When you're faced with adversities, when you're faced with stress, when you're faced with challenges, because it's going to help light up that part of your brain that's going to tell your brain, OK, need to slow down before you react. You need to slow down before you actually take the next step. And let's process this. Just keep in mind that with everything, it takes practice and consistency. So in this course, we will provide you the tools that if you practice them consistently, it will help you create the life in a better way. It will help you reach for your goals and dreams, and more importantly, it will help you stay in a better emotional state.

==== Emotional Conditioning

*So now I want to go over conditioned fear and how we become wired, how we learn and our programming, and this is actually one of my favorite topics, because once I learn how to implement some of these things in my life, I was able to start shifting so many different things, including my emotional state*.

You see, in our society, there's a common belief that we like to call the big lie. And this is the idea that our society and our childhood in our upbringing do not influence who we are today at our deepest level. So most people don't deny that those things have an impact. They think that the effect is minimal and resist believing that their emotional state and that their reactions are truly influenced by other people who form their actions and their belief systems at a younger age and throughout their development. However, the reality is that by the time that we reach adulthood, all of us have developed a pattern of how we react to life's challenges. *We have also developed a belief system and attitudes that have been shaped by those around us*. For example, our reaction to a situation may vary from what we have learned. *So when we are faced with these challenging situation, some people may shut down, others react with anger, other feel anxious and others get excited. In other words, if we view these challenges as opportunities or obstacles, many times may come down to the simple thing, which is what our conditioned response and what we've learned in the process of our life that we should be reacting to these situations. Therefore, by reflecting on how much of what we do and think did not originate as our own idea. And we let go of those things that do not serve us, we actually free ourselves to embrace a new mental state and life choices that generally resonate with who we truly are and the life that we want to live in, the life that we want to create*.

*Conditioning can be defined in many ways, but is a residual effect of all past influences in our life. Stored memories and the stored emotions in our attitude and how we react to situations, for example. How did your parents react to stress? How do they focus on the positive or negative things? How did you get attention as a child? What emotions help you connect with your parents the most?* All these might be influencing factors in a conditioned response that you now use as an adult. It is important to remember that the reason that conditioning is so powerful is because that is created part of our foundation and our understanding of life and our emotions. *You see, as a child, you're fully dependent on your parents or those around you that are playing that parental role for your own survival. In fact, if you look at a young child that is faced with a new situation, they look at the parents and know how they should react and how they should feel. Therefore, even their expressions, such as a smile, a frown, a subtle nonverbal communication for us was either a reinforcement or served as a reward or punishment*.

*This is called the KARIUS conditioning. This is where we have a reflex, response or emotion. By watching out others around us respond to the situation. Keep in mind that this is not limited to you as a child. It also happens to you as an adult that we're constantly looking at other people's emotions, how they're reacting to let us know how we should we react*. And somebody is reacting in an exaggerated way. Our mind might be saying, should we be reacting that way? Are we missing something? So we're highly influenced by other people to this type of conditioning. Also, keep in mind that our memories are tied to an emotional component, which then influences how we feel about everything in our environment, even if it's at a minimal level. For example, fear may have allowed us to escape a potential emotional or physical dangerous situation, while happiness helped us move towards a rewarding situation. In other words, our moods can be adaptive and help us throughout our own journey.

For example, anxiety. Many people see it as a negative thing, which creates fear of a potential negative situation. But there are some positives and negatives qualities you may say. How is anxiety positive with anxiety can motivate people to act or resolve a situation that otherwise we may have brushed under the rug. For example, if we feel anxiety about an exam, that anxiety may actually motivate us to study before the exam. If we feel anxious about a presentation that we're having to do, it may push us to make sure that we're fully prepared for it. However, it can also be problematic if we start associating the need to be anxious to feel compelled into action. And if you think about it, if you've ever been in school where you have to write a paper and you had a week to write it, you might have felt anxious all the time. That anxiety actually kept building up until the maybe night before where you procrastinated and then that anxiety actually pushed you because it was more pleasurable to actually work on it at that time than the anxiety that was producing. Not so it actually push you to action.

On the other hand, depression is also a mood that allows us to conserve energy when we have been overwhelmed emotionally. However, if we neglect to resolve the situation that are creating them, then it can significantly affect our lives long term. So obviously these things are pointing us to something, trying to teach us something. And if we don't listen and take care of them, then we're going to have a negative impact in every aspect of our lives. The main issue is that many of us do not know why we act the way that we do and how we may have been conditioned to feel or see things a certain way. This is why some people, when asked why they feel a certain way, they have that blank state of mind, when in fact it's because of a conditioned response is not that they don't know is because is unconscious. The reaction, for example, words can have a very powerful conditioned response. You may feel roused from a four letter word or racist comment where for someone else it might not have the same implications. It might not even have the same meaning if they grew up with people cursing around them or saying racist comments. However, you may not notice the subtle words that influence your emotion. For example, if your parent told you we need to talk every time you are in trouble and they were about to spank you, then what happens if someone else in your life as an adult tells you we need to talk? Your natural reaction would be very negative and would be full of fear. So the next part I want to talk about is learn helplessness. So what happens when you have been exposed to a situation that you did not feel that you have control over that impacts you in a negative way? Well, we develop learn helplessness, this can be having a job that we hate but have worked for it for many years, so we don't see a way out of it, a relationship full of drama, but we've invested too much time in it to let it go or even severe financial struggles that we've gone through time and time again. *Due to the learned helplessness, we stop looking for ways to change our situation and develop a belief system. We can and will not be able to change our future. Therefore, we may miss opportunities even when people are giving us that lifeline or people are trying to plant that seed to help us see life in a very different way. I do have good news and the good news is that a condition, emotional response to not have to define you or your future*. In fact, even something extreme as a phobia can be changed to what's called an extinction. So how does this happen?

*First* of all, we have to develop an awareness that we are just reacting to our programming. *Then* we have to expose ourselves to something that will let our unconscious mind see that there's other possibilities and opportunities. *Then* we have to interrupt that conditioned response when our Keusch. And *then* we replace it with something that we desire to create in our own life. *Lastly*, we take the appropriate steps to implement those possibility. This can take time, just like the original condition. *However, be patient with yourself and celebrate your success*.

So, for example, if, again, you were that child that the parent said, we need to talk. And every time they said that it meant you were going to get in trouble and get spanked, you might react in a very negative way. You might become angry, hostile, defensive, something like that. Let's say you want to change. That was the first step is to create awareness that you're reacting to that programming of your parents, because once you create that awareness, you can actually break that programming. Then you have to expose yourself to things that will show your mind that there are different possibilities. *So even yourself, when you say to somebody, I need to talk to you and then talk about something positive, or when people tell you that, tell yourself, oh, this can be something positive that they might be trying to tell me*. But even the fact that you are telling other people that you need to talk and you change the conversation, something positive, then again, that's when the season is not always going to be negative. *So the other part is interrupting their conditioning. So let's say if somebody does tell you that we need to talk instead of reacting in a negative way. React in a curious way, maybe start telling your mind. Well, I'm curious to see what they have to say. I'm curious what what they're going to talk to me about. Maybe as positive, maybe not, but without judging it*. *So if you can flip it as soon as you hear those words, expose yourself to the conditioning of curiosity instead of anger or resentment or defensiveness, then it can help you better deal with the situation, then you can replace it with your desired response. So maybe you have a key phrase that you use when someone says, I need to we need to talk or I would like to talk to you. Maybe your response could be something that you desire. Like, I'm curious to hear what you have to say. Yes. Let me know what what you want to talk about out of time now or whatever it is. Having a key phrase that opens up that opportunity might make you feel different*. So what is that response that you would like to give instead of anger, instead of anxiety about that response and then take the appropriate steps to implement it when you have those opportunities to do so? *So some of the questions that might be good for you to ask yourself are what did you learn about sadness from your upbringing? From your parent, from those around you, how is it expressed, how did it people when they were sad, how did they react? What did they do also? What did you learn from fear? How did people express fear in your life? How do they react to fear? What about happiness? What did you learn about happiness and how was happiness expressed in your environment? The people yell, people just smile, the people dance, what do they do to express when they were happy or they did not express happiness? What about anxiety? What did you learn about anxiety? I was anxiety expressed in your life, in your upbringing*.

Also, you should look at how did people. Around you cope with stress and challenging situations. Because, again, we all have a different way of coping with stress, but a lot of that is learned response from what we saw people around us as they cope with stress themselves. Lastly, how did people connect to each other? Did they argue with each other to connect, did they scream and yell at each other, they instead show love and affection to connect to each other. Or were they emotionally disengaged or maybe your parents would come in and say hello and instead of how is your day superficial conversation, then they both went their own ways that their own thing. Again, that conditioned response is very, very powerful, and I'll give you a perfect example of how it works. I had a student. That had a relationship with boyfriend and that person live far away, and that person wanted to call her every day, a couple of times a day and see how she was doing and things like that. And to her, that was weird because she just wanted him to call maybe every two or three days. She didn't see a need to talk every day or say good night to each other. And he was thinking about moving closer and that was freaking her out because he's going to move closer. He's probably going to want to see me every day or every couple of days. We're good as we are. We see each other every weekend, but sometimes every other week. And I'm good with that. That's how relationships supposed to be. So I asked her a simple question, what did your dad do for a living? And as soon as I asked that, you could see her whole state changed. She looked at me with this big eyes open and said, my dad used to travel all the time and he was only home on the weekends and we had already talked about conditioning. So she was kind of already mentally prepared to have this understanding. But she realized that she was just following her own programming of what she saw between her mom and her dad. They barely talked on the phone, and the only time that they really interacted was every weekend or every other weekend because during the week he was on the road. But then she assessed it, she said, maybe this is not what I want from my relationship, maybe I do want a relationship where I have more contact and I feel closer to them, where we communicate more often. So, again, that would be her choice, but now that she understands that she's just following her programming, she can make that decision at a conscious level. *Again, conditioning is very powerful and you have everything you need to be able to change it. And it starts by becoming aware of your emotions, which obviously is something that we're going to give you the tools to be able to do that. And as you become aware, you can see where they're coming from and maybe what influence and developed that. That way you can truly get them at their core and get the root cause of your reactions and your emotional state and how you view the world*. Thank you.
